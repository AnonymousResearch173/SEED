If human answering takes a deep dive, it would have a lot less training data to work with. So it's in both OpenAI and SO's best interest to find a way to integrate I think. 

Biggest issue is token limit, long term memory and 0 shot learning. 

The caveat would be if we can find a model with some sort of liquid learning, with a nearly unlimited token limit, that could also basically update/finetune it's training and use larger reasoning. 

Then it could ingest a whole library, and do things like write docs, answer questions, fix bugs. But right now those limits are pretty hard, and that's something we haven't really seen much development in. 

I think it would require models other than generative pretrained transformers, models we don't currently have. Token limits and lack of a real longterm/shorterm memory that isn't just a hack or workaround stop it from really replacing it now. 

I think the next big breakthrough may come with either an entirely new model that's more multimodal, or parallel models trained on entirely different data that work with a language model to give it more capability. Like a brain.

A model specifically made for encoding short and longterm memory and recall, a model specifically made for inferring code functionality, a model specifically made for abstract reasoning, a model specifically made for coordination.

Right now there's a couple very BIG hard limits to things like ChatGPT (as impressive as it is) that are probably a long ways off yet. (4+ years to see first iterations). 

As of now we can only jankily hack around them, but that's not really a solution as you can only paint over the shortcomings, not remove them.

Regardless of how good the workarounds are, you can't teach it do ingest a couple millions lines of code and tell you why you're getting an error. The best we will do in that regard is as you describe, which IMO is okay but not anything that's gonna replace the real reason people go to SO. 

Maybe I'm wrong, would be curious about your project when you have something. But having gone down the rabbit hole since early access beta in 2019 or whenever, I think that these are still very limiting issues that currently can't be hacked around. Having played around with this since gpt2 days, I think I have a good understanding of the real hard limits and imo this is one. Regardless of how much you compress memories, fitting the context needed into 10k tokens just really isn't feasible and the actual abstract reasoning isn't there and probably won't be until we find a way to actually train a model to do that.

And then you still need to check all of these answers as they are good, but sometimes can be wrong which means that in the case of having always the right answer for the question is also not completely the case.

It can answer questions so accurately that it's legitimately scary

It will be just as scary when it's wrong, but many won't realize until the consequences™ come.

Would a bot such as this one change the future of question and answer sites?

With the benefit of hindsight, to a degree, yes, of course, and to some degree, they'll continue to do so.

For context, this post's original revisions took a much more defensive stance, viewing the question from an angle of ""how useful would it be for AI-generated answers be posted on Stack Exchange?"" My previous answer focused heavily on need for quality in questions, and my defense for the continuing value of the Stack Exchange network was based on ""garbage in, garbage out""- both for questions and source/training data:

If someone doesn't know how to ask a good question, they're going to have a harder time getting a good answer from an LLM tool.

For any new field with less information about it included in LLM training data and less SEO juice to get good info found in web search results, likelihood of a LLM + search engine giving useful results is probably going to be low.


A year has passed, and the aspect of this question that I find interesting has changed. Concerning the future of Stack Exchange, my new interest is in the net benefits this technology has provided / is providing- not on the whole world, but here.


could this be a way to accurately answer questions that are on any of the Stack Exchange sites?

Sure? (to an extent.) Nowadays, there are hybrids of search engines and LLMs, so all it needs to do is do a web search, and basically churn and regurgitate any existing answer content.
I've heard tons of people online and my friends say that they find technologies like ChatGPT to be a useful tool for getting answers to questions. Many of them who have newbie experience on Stack Exchange comment that they prefer it over Stack Exchange so they don't have to deal with grumpy experts.
That's what ChatGPT is good at: service with a smile, all the time.
People like that. Traffic has certainly declined (see Did Stack Exchange's traffic go down since ChatGPT?).
Okay, so how the heck do I see benefit in that?
Dealing with problematic question content is costly. It costs time, and it costs patience. It costs that to deal with questions that are missing key details, questions that are (for lack of better description) just a mess, questions that are duplicates, questions where potential for long-term value is covered in three feet of unnecessary context (and usually the hidden gem has already been asked before), etc. And each of those categories abound endlessly. Deal with it enough and it sucks the joy out of building a long-term knowledgebase.
ChatGPT and similar technologies do two things for that:

It ""tricks"" people into doing research and basic troubleshooting.
I say ""trick"", but really I mean that it masks research-related activities into a form that people find palatable. For some reason, many people either don't like to, or don't know how to google things (not that googling is a pre-requisite for asking a question on Stack Exchange (see How should we deal with Google questions? and Embrace the non-Googlers), but in my experience, it's usually (for question askers) a better search engine than the one built into Stack Exchange sites). But when the search engine is hidden behind a conversation with a machine, suddenly people find it very attractive (I guess the degree of synthesis and summarization (accurate/faithful or not) is also a factor).
This isn't always a productive thing. We all know that an LLM can spit out falsehood as well as it can spit out truth. It can mislead people, and that can result in those people posting weird questions on Stack Exchange (Ex. I'm trying to do X and ChatGPT told me to do Y (which makes no sense)).
But a lot of duplicates are very poor in quality, and less of those is a good thing. It means less curation workload, and less clutter mucking up searchability (bad signposts weigh out good ones). I've also started to see a (very small but hopefully increasing) trend in questions that show actually useful information prompted by conversation with an LLM. While this is slightly disappointing to me, since a lot of basic troubleshooting can be written statically and has no need for neural network involvement, it would seem that many of the people who love this technology are not the type to seek out the loving manual.

It (to some degree) deals with the boring, obscure, one-off requirement dumps / questions that just require a lot of synthesis of basic concepts / questions with a bunch of unnecessary context.
Or at least- that's what it seems to me like people who are trying to develop developer tooling around these technologies are trying to apply it to do.
People are often too lazy to do or just don't know how to do is generalize their questions (de-localize / create things like Minimal Reproducible Examples) while not blowing up the question scope (staying focused), or to break them down into separate questions that are appropriately scoped for Stack Exchange. I don't get an awful lot of those questions in the tags I answer in, so I don't know how much this situation has changed, but I hope that among the classes of questions that are no longer being posted, there are fewer of these.


And in doing those boring things, it doesn't get grumpy. It has no social battery (well, it consumes a heck ton of energy to run, but that's a different can of worms).
I don't particularly care if ChatGPT wastes someone's time with a bunch of unhelpful info.
To the contrary, I welcome any side-effect that this technology has had on reduction in lower-quality question posts / increase in overall quality of question posts on Stack Exchange.
There are potential hidden costs- fewer people using the sites directly means fewer votes (and voting matters), and potentially missing some gems of questions and losing out on them to the machine. But a lot of people can't vote anyway, and I think if a question is useful enough, as long as this platform itself can retain its reputation as a trusted resource, the gems will find their way here.

SO_Thread_Could ChatGPT be a viable way to answer people39s questions.csv,,,-12,171,0,"I would think there is definitely scope for AI to assist humans in providing good answers. Especially the latest version ChatGPT4 (with plugins like Wolfram Alpha for maths or ScholarAI or the web browser plugins to give sources) has very good performance quantified based on various benchmarks, e.g. ability to solve university entrance exams correctly (often top10% relative to avg. human) or maths ability. See my answer here giving some examples of how with the help of ChatGPT4 I was able to answer various SO questions, including ones that had never received an answer, despite being highly ranked and having been awarded 4 bounties before. Of course adequate advice on responsible AI use would need to be given, cf. the guidelines of many academic journals like PNAS on the use of generative AI. Especially for programming related questions I think allowing responsible AI usage could be beneficial. The guideline should then include that if ChatGPT or Github Copilot was used to develop code that reproducible code & a benchmark plus output should be given (confirming that the user verified the code works correctly, ChatGPT can't yet run code yet) & that use of ChatGPT should be disclosed & a reputable source should be given. That is very easy to check - much easier than telling if a given answer might have used ChatGPT if not disclosed. I would also not allow for plain copy & paste answers. So critical that appropriate guardrails to counter abuse would be in place. But I definitely see scope for humans & AI to work together to answer some of the questions on SO, especially when it concerns programming related questions (where reproducible code would make them easy to verify) and questions that never received an adequate reply. I would also suggest to add a checkbox ""GPT assisted answer"" so that user that would not like to see this content could still disable this if they would like. But why not make use of the free knowledge of user paying for ChatGPT4 & those that use it to assist in helping to answer questions on SO? If I look at the questions I ever asked on Cross Validated / Stats Stackexchange there is only 8 out of 20 questions that ever received an adequate answer, 3 of which I provided myself. If I paste the remaining unanswered questions in ChatGPT4 I would have checked 83% of the answers as being mostly or entirely correct (i.e. I would have marked them as correct accepted answers). With a bit of extra work these answers could surely be improved a bit further & it would be valuable to have them as correct, vetted answers.
Also, let's not forget: all those that having Bing as their search engine now by default get a GPT4 produced answer to their web search queries. So I would think that perhaps for most answers GPT now at least provided some inspiration for any answer... The important part is just teaching users how to use this technology responsibly & provide clear guidance on how to use it, as well as to point out its limitations. Imho, instead of fighting AI, humans and AI should work together to lift their abilities to a new level and allow them to solve problems they couldn't solve before. In the same way that we don't expect mathematicians or physicists to solve everything with pencil and paper and stop using computers.

Even assuming that Google's CEO has an accurate picture of who and how writes their gargantuan code base, what they do is not our concern.

Using AI to assist with software development is not the same as presenting solutions to other people's questions as if you were a subject-matter expert.


The main issues with AI posts (answers in particular) which prompted the ban all remain:

No matter how good a GenAI model is, they can still hallucinate. There's even research that suggests AI models may never not hallucinate. The burden of vetting such content that looks good on the surface but may be fundamentally flawed then falls on the shoulders of an already strained community.
GenAI content can be produced at a much faster rate than what the community is able to curate/moderate
Even for vetted content, moderators (but anyone except the poster really) are unable to verify claims that the content was actually vetted beforehand. It'd come down to hunches and subjective bias. That kind of moderation is prone to be unfair and ineffective.
plagiarism: after having handled thousands of AI flags on this site, I can tell you that almost nobody gives proper credit to the AI. Folks tend to present the content as their own, thus misrepresenting someone else's work.
The only value proposition that Stack Overflow still has over an LLM is that there's the expectation that a human being has authored the text as written.
Allowing for an exception this big to the AI ban would open the floodgates.

There is a case to be made about using AI to improve a post's grammar, formatting, etc. but that suffers from the same issues as point #3.
I really don't see how we could realistically allow AI content in almost any form while staying true to Stack Overflow's values and a Community made of humans at its core.

Stack Overflow was like School, it's technically 'a place to learn' but actually no one smart hangs out there, and it's really just a place for a few assholes to get 'stars' (basically **exactly** like grade school).

It was a bit of a running joke all the way thru that any question with real content would be locked / deleted quickly (and for seemingly irrelevant reasons) while totally silly and irrelevant arguments pages last for years.

Really glad that it's clearly dead these days and that AI has undercut any need for it, it was a horrid experiment gone wrong showing what happens when egos and disgusting self victimizers are allowed to dominate over merit.

And even if you gave it ten times as much training data, it still couldn't do it, no matter how good that training data was.
GPT-3, the large language model underlying ChatGPT, is certainly an impressive piece of language processing software. But that's all it is. ChatGPT is not intended to be an artificial intelligence, although it may give some people the initial impression that it has some intelligence.
ChatGPT generates plausible text, consistent with its training data and input, but it doesn't know what it's talking about, and it has no way of representing or evaluating the truth of its utterances. Yes, it can say true things, but it can also say complete nonsense, and it can't tell the difference.
ChatGPT does not attempt to make truthful or even logical statements. Its job is to create ""completions"" of the text you feed it. It's ultimately doing the same kind of tasks as the spelling-checker and word suggestion feature supplied with modern phone keyboards, except that it's working with deeper and broader linguistic structures.
It has no problems making grammatically correct utterances with no spelling errors, and those utterances are linguistically consistent with the input you feed it and its training data. But it's only operating on linguistic structure, it is oblivious to the underlying logic and truth value of the statements it makes. It may emit text which is logically valid and true, but that's just a fortunate side-effect of the linguistic structure and its training data. In extended passages, it can easily say things that are logically inconsistent. And it has no way to evaluate how relevant its utterances are to the input data, apart from the linguistic consistency. So when it says true and useful things that's just a lucky coincidence.
ChatGPT often makes stupid errors of logic and silly arithmetic errors. OTOH, we have theorem-proving AI that can handle complex logic, and sophisticated mathematical systems that can do arithmetic, algebra, and calculus. In the future, we will surely have natural language software that can handle logic and mathematics, but the current incarnation of ChatGPT won't magically gain those abilities merely by throwing more training data at it.

On Cross Validated / Stats Stackexchange only 8 out of my 20 questions I asked were ever answered (with an answer that I accepted) - 3 of which by myself. That's only a success rate of 25% to get useful help from others that solved my original problem. If I paste the unanswered questions into ChatGPT4 I would count about 83% as useful & largely or entirely correct (i.e. I would have given them a checkmark, whereas the current answers are either beating about the bush, not solving my original problem or are plain wrong & for some there is no answer at all).
Sometimes it takes a bit of prodding to get things right, but so does getting a correct answer on Stack Overflow - that also usually still requires prodding other users posting answers and telling them ""no, I would like this or that instead"" or ""your solution is not working because xxx"" etc. I would say that most of the info on ChatGPT here on SO is (1) factually incorrect, (2) highly outdated & referring to ChatGPT3.5, not ChatGPT4 and (3) extremely opinionated. For example, this article citing the poor maths capabilities of ChatGPT applies to ChatGPT3.5, not ChatGPT4, which can now use the Wolfram Alpha plugin and according to recent benchmarks in fact excels at math. And with the use of the ScholarAI & browser plugin it can also give sources. Sure, anything that comes out needs checking. But most current Stack Overflow answers could also use a thorough check & a lot of edits.
So I would see good scope for AI and humans to work together to tilt our capabilities to a new level & get good answers for more questions here on SO. But of course with appropriate guardrails in place to prevent abuse. And mainly in the context of programming related questions, where I would then require reproducible code and output or benchmarks plus citation of a credible source & disclosure of the use of ChatGPT or Github Copilot if it was used, to make sure that any answers are actually correct. I would also not accept plain copy & paste answers. Nowadays most of us will probably be at least inspired by GPT when answering any question really. For those that Google using BING GPT4 is now the default search engine...

Here is an answer from ChatGPT itself:

While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for answering a wide range of
questions, Stack Overflow still serves a valuable purpose as a
community-driven platform for technical Q&A. Rather than replacing
Stack Overflow, ChatGPT could be used in conjunction with the site to
provide additional support and guidance for users.
One possibility would be to integrate ChatGPT's capabilities into
Stack Overflow's existing interface, allowing users to ask questions
in a conversational format and receive instant responses. This could
potentially help users who are struggling to formulate their questions
or who are looking for guidance on how to approach a particular
problem.
However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks of such an
approach, such as the risk of information overload or the possibility
of inaccurate or incomplete responses. Ultimately, any changes to
Stack Overflow should be carefully evaluated to ensure that they align
with the site's goals of providing accurate, high-quality technical
information to users

Your thoughts and views on this matter are welcome...

Speed yes, accuracy no. One example is not enough to draw any conclusion. Please conduct a more thorough investigation.
The speed of the response generation of the service you used is indeed impressive, although I wouldn't say it's necessarily much faster than using a search engine like Google and clicking on the presented link to Stack Overflow, for example.
Accuracy is unfortunately not yet that good. In same cases it gave acceptable results, but in others not, when I tested it. I cannot recommend it yet.
Why is your and my experience so vastly different? Maybe because you drew a conclusion from only a very small amount of examples (N=1?). That cannot work. There hasn't been done enough example generation and evaluation for the claim to be supported by the evidence.
It's futile to discuss the implications of something we do not know with sufficient certainty yet. We need to study this service more. I'm quite sure that scientists do that already.
Just as a side comment. ChatGPT is competition (capable or incapable) for this platform, but for a knowledge seeker it's just another (useful or not useful) source of information. How useful? The jury is still out.

Unless I've been manipulating it poorly, quite simply, ChatGPT takes a great deal of prodding and pleading to get a complete, correct response from, when a correct response is achievable at all. It's a tool, basically a jacked-up autocomplete that's wrong, say, more than half the time.
For example, here's some code it wrote for an extremely trivial programming task, finding the minimum element in an enumerable in Elixir:
def find_smallest(numbers) do
  Enum.min(numbers)
end

Fine and well. I asked it to translate this code to Dart and it provided this wrong answer[1]:

To solve the problem of finding the smallest number in a list in Dart, you can use the min function from the dart:math library.
Here is an example of how you could implement the find_smallest function in Dart:
import 'dart:math';

int findSmallest(List<int> numbers) {
  return numbers.min();
}

You can then use the expect function from the package:test library to write test cases for the function.
[bunch of test cases that the function fails on]

This is the sort of plausible-looking ChatGPT-based answer you'd see flooding Stack Overflow before the ban.
I'm not a Dart programmer, so after this failed, I looked it up on SO to find the human solution. This isn't an isolated incident. It's the typical workflow using ChatGPT at the present time.
There's no doubt that it's an amazing piece of technology that's correct some of the time. It's helped me quickly solve certain problems over the past few weeks. I don't doubt that it solved the problem you mentioned for you. When successful, it's magic. The problem is, it reveals itself as unreliable once you put it through the ringer on a variety of problems. I'm not talking about 80% accuracy, from what I've seen, more like 40% accuracy.

But technology is advancing and we are becoming more and more independent of human skill to find solutions to programming challenges

Not really. Human skill is just as important as ever. Nowadays, one needs to be extremely judicious about separating fact from fiction and separating plausible-looking solutions from truly correct ones.
Unless large strides are made soon, ChatGPT is nowhere near replacing Stack Overflow or programmers in general any more than self-driving mode will be replacing human drivers.

[1]: I'm aware that asking the same question again, differently or at a later time may give the correct answer for this problem. That doesn't change the fact that it fails catastrophically like this often, on simple tasks.

Given that most high-rep users got that way in the first place mostly by answering questions, this claim is close to self-defeating.

VonC didn't ignore 29,184 questions. I could keep going with this, but the point is the vast majority of people become high-rep by answering lots of questions.

With the emergence and popularity of ChatGPT and its multiple strengths with regards to coding (despite there still being some weaknesses) including the size of its knowledge base, there seems to arise a natural question: What is the future of role of Stack Exchange?
For new programmers, the ability to ask simple code related queries and get instant feedback entails a short and direct approach. Whereas a question posed on Stack Overflow may end up being down-voted or being relegated to a similar question, whereupon the user is being forced to translate the syntax to their exact problem (which many newcomers struggle with).
Clearly the usage of AIs is riddled with deeper issues, i.e., such as credibility of output and user comprehension. Which to a newcomer are not readily available skills, but are accumulated over the course of their learning experiences.
Yet, the question still stands:
What is the future of Stack Exchange and similar communities on the Internet? Have we already generated enough data for AI to take it to the next level?

It's not that we don't welcome beginner questions- we do if they meet those standards (see for example, What is the proper way to approach Stack Overflow as someone totally new to programming?).

Not sure about the matter? Try finding a new post on Stack Overflow and pasting it in ChatGPT. Compare it to the question and consider how well the AI answered. Perhaps you might even find an answered post which looks eerily similar to the answer provided.

Hm. If an AI can answer something correctly, yes- I have to wonder whether that question had already been asked and answered before on Stack Exchange, or if the question could be broken down into multiple atomic questions where that's true. Or maybe the question is covered so well outside of Stack Exchange that some Stack Exchange network sites would shoot down the question for showing lack of research (from what I've read, different Stack Exchange network sites have different standards for how much research is required when it comes to researching through resources outside of the Stack Exchange network).
Even if future AIs try to create similar content to us, we'll be doing it in entirely different ways
If the question is a good question according to a Stack Exchange network site's standards and is on-topic for the site, even if an AI can give a good answer, I see no reason to say that the question shouldn't be given the good 'ol Stack Exchange treatment: Ask a good question -> get a good answer. Some users would benefit from getting multiple answers to a question ex. explaining a concept in different ways.
The other major benefits of Stack Exchange are our voting and peer-review systems. People can vote on answers to say whether they are useful or not (among other things), and people can suggest edits to improve posts. With both our voting system and our peer-review system, access to contribute is a privilege earned by demonstrating to others that you (to some degree) know what you are talking about (reputation). This kind of reputation system we have seems (to me) to be incompatible with some platform where content is created by AIs.

Accuracy

AI is very often completely making things up, spreading completely wrong information, exaggeratting correct information, or otherwise not giving you a correct and working answer. Yes, people do that too, but here we have lots of people who know what they are doing and can point out if the answer is wrong.

Bias

If I ask AI something, it will change its answer heavily from very subtle biases in the question, in a way that a human will not. This isn't great, since the goal is to get an answer that works/answers your question, not one echoing your opinion.

Sourcing

A human can say where they got information from, and that can be verified to be true. An AI really can't (it will often say it can and then give non-extant sources, broken links, etc.)

Not good for Q&A format

AI generally responds with essays, not really answers like a human does here. This makes sense, as it is after all a chatbot. A chatbot is meant to chat, not to answer complex questions, and as such does it worse.

An AI is never accountable. Most generative AI at present cannot account for even where it got its knowledge from. A human may forget, and occationally cargo cult things, but the knowledge started somewhere.
While Plagiarism and link only answers are a problem as old as the network, a good chunk of our answers come from experience, either guided, or by experimentation. A human can hack at a problem till its correct, work through a process of reasoning, and even if they don't understand how an answer was derived, show you how they got there.
An AI does not know if its answers are correct. It combines a statistically plausible set of words that may or may not be correct. It does not have the capacity to think through an answer (yet?) or to test it.
It also doesn't have the capacity to think  or synthesize. When its good for simple questions, often Q&A involves reasoning
I asked the 'free' version of chatgpt a version of this question.
I don't know if it could parse my network config and output, and a human would start asking me about these things. I'd note this  is exactly what I started with as a problem, and the rest of the pair was from me hacking at it.

I'm currently speed/capacity testing one of the onboard I226-V and the bundled AQC113. Each has its own (currently dynamic, but stable) IP. If I turn on the system, or reboot without the I226-V plugged into the network - I am unable to connect to the AQC113. The AQC113 comes up immediately on the I226V being connected. I can't ping the system if the I226V is unplugged even on the AQC113's IP at any time.
Can you tell me how to fix this?

Give it a shot, or even try the full question. It just has no idea. Neither did I but I had the hardware in front of me, and was willing to try, and eventually tied some seemingly unrelated knowledge to it.
ChatGPT won't ask you 'what OS are you running' or 'can you share your network config"" it'll give you an answer, but not necessarily one that's confirmed to be correct.
And that is the difference - a computer can't try things, have curiosity or get nerdbaited. ChatGPT and its equivalents are adequate for simple already existing answers (sometimes) but when they get complex or specialised, lack the breadth and depth.
I've even had people write software to solve a problem or troubleshoot an issue I had. ChatGPT does not judge you, but it does not care about the problem either. It'll give you something that feels good, but is essentially informational (or maybe unformational) junk food.
FWIW, it ended up being a poorly documented interaction between multigig cards, which ended up with me needing to set metrics manually for each interface. I have a theory but chatgpt wouldn't give me a good answer to why - I suspect its because 2 in 2.5 is a bigger number than the 1 in 10. But you can see the complete failure to try to solve the question. It gave me, well a practically useless checklist, without any real clear things to check.
Pretty much it didn't answer my question - which admittedly was very niche. It did not judge me, but this was hardly multifaceted or correct. It didn't do any real troubleshooting outside providing me a list of vague things to try. It ideated but did not have an idea. It also completely missed the very subtle point here - which needed some niche knowledge I remembers from a completely different OS

In today's era where artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly ubiquitous

Saying that something is becoming ubiquitous sounds more like hype than fact, it's as if you want to valorize the buzzword, which like all trends will disappear and people will get used to it. Artificial Intelligence is just a tool and it is as a tool that it should be seen.

what significance does a Q&A website still hold？

Perhaps the right question is not to ask how significant Q&As are today. Q&A and LLM are different tools, with different objetives, aimed at different audiences.
Possibly the right question is who are you these days? Are you a Q&A user or an LLM user?
I think using Q&As or LLMs ia an individual matter and not transferable. Each one will decide for themselves and won't let other people's opinions influence their choice. Don't think about the choice your fellow has made, just consider what's best for you.
If LLM provides you with answers that it considers good enough, then you are not a target audience for Q&A, so don't waste your time or ours. Be happy with the chat bot.
Observing that the same professional whose questions are easily answered by an answer-generating machine is the same professional who can be replaced by a question-generating machine.
If the LLM models can't answer your questions, or because they simply hallucinate, or because the required knowledge was produced after the AI cut-off date, or because they don't cite corroborated sources to back up the information they provide, or because they generate limited and repetitive explanations,or because LLM doesn't know logic or math....., or whatever reason you have for disliking and distrusting LLM-generated content; you may be a candidate for a Q&A user.
Being a candidate Q&A user is not the same as being able to use a Q&A. Using Q&As takes effort and resilience, and the learning curve for the rules of a Q&A can be long and difficult at first.

First off, import order. Is it random, or did you just throw darts at a list of imports? You're importing half of the world here, but it seems like you've never even heard of isort or flake8. And what’s with all the redundant imports? Are we really using randbytes here? Oh wait, we’re not. Just a random import for your collection, I suppose?

Let’s talk about logging. You’re logging every single step like you're narrating a documentary about how basic functions work. Nobody cares that you ""started hashing a password."" What are you doing, applying for a security clearance? Here’s a hint: a clean log should provide value, not read like a day-by-day diary of a bored developer.

The password change validation? Chef’s kiss. What if the passwordConfirm mismatches? You just serve up the same pointless log statement that we all saw coming. It’s like you've never heard of a proper response structure. ""Oh no, passwords don’t match!"" Welcome to the world of lazy validation.

Speaking of lazy, could you please, please stop with this Frankenstein’s monster of mixed responsibilities in your endpoints? You’re registering a user, hashing passwords, checking verification, setting cookies, and logging in—all in one blob of code. Who needs clean, modular services when you can throw everything into a 200-line method, right?

Not to be pedantic, but I have to wonder how many of the people who are upset about this issue also use adblockers. Because I imagine it's a huge proportion. And it's not because they're hypocrites; I resisted using adblockers for years because of the ethics of obtaining information for free that someone else paid to collect and display. But I use an adblocker now because the internet is *absolute garbage.* [This article](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) calls what's happened ""enshitification,"" and I think it explains why people are so head-over-heels eager to use ChatGPT. Finding information online has been miserable for years, and we finally have effective relief.

Let's say no-one regulates what OpenAI and its competitors have done. It happened and it's over. All the shitty websites that dangled information you wanted behind 500 words of filler to keep you on the page while blasting you with ads shut down. Also, a lot of reasonably good websites that were creating valuable information (which was then being reposted by a mountain of shitty ones) go down with them. There's suddenly no way to learn new things on the internet; all we have is what AI knows and what you can ask a human, plus donation-based sites like Wikipedia that will probably never shut down, even though their traffic declined.

What do AI companies need, now? Information. And what do they have to do? Pay for it. Research, journalism on that research, solutions to weird tech problems, community discussions, etc. There's suddenly a market for unanswered questions. I don't know if anyone can say exactly what that looks like, but I know one thing: AI companies will pay for what once was paid for with ads.

Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that the only place with a standard high enough to train an effective LLM on, would be hated on by the users of the LLM.

If you sort by new and unanswered questions on SO, you will see just exactly why there are strict rules on asking questions.

SO is not for your minor uncertainty or first attempt at solving a problem. The amount of questions ""answered"" by an OP themselves moments later with some ""Nevermind, I forgot to add a closing bracket"" is staggering.

What people here are interpreting as arrogance and malicious intent is experienced users taking their time to answer people's questions freely.

You SHOULD be hesitant to ask a question on SO.

That means you will first try all you can to search for an actual answer, to actually frame your questioning. I cannot count how many times I have found something to try out that have solved my issues just my thoroughly structuring my question.

For newbie questions or quick feedback, use ""learn programming"" or ""programmingquestions"" on reddit, IRC or discord. THAT is the purpose of those tools.

The purpose of SO is in no way, shape or form that.

It is for high quality answered, to high quality questions.

""why does my conda environment fail on my home computer, but works on my job"" type questions is not high quality. Especially when 50 other users have asked pretty much the same question in the last week, only with some specifics to their own setup. 

It is a local and isolated question that can only be answered in a local and isolated context.

If you framed the same question, with with cross referenced chiseled out error messages, included possible similar issues from doing some research, with a focused description of what it is you fail to understand, THEN users would be able to actually help you.

SO is NOT the place to go to for casual help on something we are to lazy to look into or solve ourselves. And that is the power of SO. 

Asking low quality unstructured questions have to be discredited in order to keep both questions and answers in a high enough quality for an LLM to be able to use it. 

With out the gatekeeping of low quality questions, the quality of answers will dry up. 

Without the quality answers to quality questions on SO, the quality of LLM's will dry up, as an LLM is not able to actually answer anything, but only reference the most useful previously answered question in the context.",SO,positive,"Shocking, defending",,

It's also great when you can't figure out a syntax issue in an unfamiliar part of a framework.

You can paste a function and ask it to optimize it, it will even explain why it made certain changes. 

I don't like that it falls on its face on dumb stuff. I asked it to read all of the .log files in a folder (IIS format), find the lines that met a particular pattern and capture a few parameters. It wrote a damn clean function to do this, but it fumbled the array indexes for picking the columns within each row. Still, I spent less time troubleshooting that, than what it would take me to write it from scratch.

In t-sql it is fantastic, I like it for complex jobs that require convoluted loops/cursors/etc.

I can ask it the most basic questions and get an answer quickly. SO would get my question downvoted instantly, and I would have just wasted 5 minutes typing it.
