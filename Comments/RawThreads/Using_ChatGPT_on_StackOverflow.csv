But you can only suppress the inevitable for so long.

19,,0,lint_it,11,4698,None,0,"If you are going to answer to a question where you actually have little idea about the topic and hardly know if the answer is actually going to be correct then how is it different from just copy pasting random answer that may seems like correct one found from google? I mean its results will be pretty much the same just with less effort when using AI.

If you are going to use it to aid finding an correct answer or to get to better know the context then it makes sense but trusting an answer from an AI (it has been confirmed that it makes good amount of mistakes) and just copy pasting it's answers will indeed, without any surprise, result in low success rate.

At least I would have found it much more interesting and useful if you would have researched if using an AI would aid finding correct answers faster or not. This one seems more like exploiting than anything else... (at least in my eyes)

But like you said at least you learned something from it so it is not all that bad...",48,2022-12-05 00:21:01

21,20,2,allen_jb,84,24763,None,0,"I think it would be better for questions to go unanswered than to give potentially wrong / misleading answers.

ChatGPT gives absolutely no guarantees that what any of it says is correct. In my opinion it's really little better than the markov chain bots of old - it's still just stringing together words without any real understanding of their meaning or context, and thus their correctness.",5,2022-12-05 09:07:20
22,19,1,AMLyf,4780,11718,None,0,"This. I can already see how this will complicate SO in the future. ""Hey bud, they changed the requirements for x issue that you originally stated, did you do the refactor and if so how?"" and since the person using GPT didn't actually understand the issue, they have no valid input for  the new requests that come to that thread / SO post. Thus making more SO posts about the same issue.   


Sometimes providing an answer on SO doesn't help anyone till years later when the issue is more common. I've been on week long *rabbit hole* searches for answers to questions that are very relevant today, but the last post would read something like ""i fixed it, never-mind"". This is the equivalent.",2,2022-12-05 14:09:27

29,,0,Deleted,N/A,N/A,None,0,I’ve found using chatGPT to debug snippets of code to be an excellent tool. It also is very good at explaining what code is doing. Just a few minutes I had it fix some buggy code that relied on string slices and it proposed a much better solution.

How do use it to debug existing code? I thought it was like copilot in that you write a description of what you want and it gives you an answer, not that you would input existing code

33,30,2,Deleted,N/A,N/A,None,0,"First of all, you have to go in not trusting it completely. Also, there is a text limit so it’s better to just give it function snippets so it has some context but isn’t a massive block of code otherwise it will maybe only print out have the answer. I’ll ask what the function does. Then I’ll ask it what problems it has. Or if get an error
Message I’ll give it the line of code and the error message. This thing is known to be confidently incorrect but if you call it on it’s mistakes it will usually fix them. It takes some getting used to, but treat it like a coworker/mentor when you get stuck. It can walk you through the code and explain it.

34,,0,ze_do_pneu_,1676,2547,None,0,"When something becomes a trend, people tend to do  a lot of useless stuff.

You have the example of KickStarter that had a lot of useless IoT projects because IoT was trending back then. 

Now you have AI, people are adding the word ""AI"" to products just to sell more, even though the product itself probably doesn't need artificial intelligence, and they struggle to implement some AI to the product instead of building something that solves people's problems.

Now with chatGPT people tend to create articles about useless things that they've done such as using the algorythm to answer StackOverflow questions",7,2022-12-05 09:08:23

It doesn't have the ability to take a guess at how much it doesn't know like humans do either so sometimes it will just very confidently make a bunch of shit up.",2,2022-12-05 13:40:41
