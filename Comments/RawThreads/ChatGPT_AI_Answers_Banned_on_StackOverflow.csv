Once you master the tool (ai generation of code) you'll know how to formulate and correct the ai with the best prompts to write entire classes in only couple of minutes without perfect libraries and/or dependencies knowledge.

Incoming developers are going to be able to churn large codebases in highly reduced time, libraries are going to become more and more complete as they'll also be AI generated.

We'll still code but higher level stuffs than what is done today.

""Come on, Mr. Jones,"" GimmickNG said. ""What's in the box?""

Mr. Jones sighed and said, ""It's none of your business, GimmickNG. Now go home and leave me alone.""

But GimmickNG wouldn't listen. He followed Mr. Jones all the way home and even peeked through the window to try and see what was inside the box. Finally, Mr. Jones had enough and he called the police.

When the police arrived, they asked GimmickNG why he was being so nosy and he couldn't give them a good answer. The police told him that it was rude and disrespectful to ask about other people's private business and that he should be more considerate of others' feelings.

GimmickNG felt ashamed and embarrassed. He realized that his nosiness had gotten him into trouble and that he needed to be more respectful of others' privacy. From then on, GimmickNG made sure to mind his own business and not ask any nosy questions. He learned his lesson and never bothered anyone again.",3,2022-12-05 19:08:41

    Verse 1:
    I'm Stephen Hawking, the smartest man alive
    I'll take you on a journey, back in time
    To the beginning of everything, the big bang
    A cosmic explosion that set the stage
    For the universe to unfold and evolve
    A never-ending story, a cosmic resolve

    Verse 2:
    Galaxies formed, stars were born
    Planets and moons, each unique and adorned
    The universe expanded, at a rapid pace
    A vast and wondrous place, full of grace
    But also violence, as stars collided
    Creating black holes, deep and wide

    Verse 3:
    Life emerged on earth, a miracle in its own
    From single-celled organisms, to complex creatures known
    The dinosaurs roamed, but they didn't last
    Killed off by a comet, in a cosmic blast
    But life continued, adapting and changing
    Evolution the key, to surviving and arranging

    Verse 4:
    Humans evolved, and civilizations rose
    From ancient empires, to modern day foes
    But we have also thrived, advancing technology
    Exploring the universe, to see what we can see
    But with great power, comes great responsibility
    We must protect our planet, for posterity

    Verse 5:
    The universe is vast, and still expanding
    A never-ending journey, still demanding
    But we must strive to understand it all
    And continue to explore, with knowledge and gall
    The history of the universe, a tale to be told

You don't know what it does under the hood. To predict next token, it's helpful to have some models of the world, obviously. It's absurd to say it does _no_ problem solving. Obviously it's not perfect. If it were, it'd be way bigger deal. But it is impressive. Progress is _fast_.

297,,0,coderstephen,1921,27592,None,0,"I wanted to chime in on the recent ban on AI-generated answers. While I understand why you made the decision, I think it's a mistake to exclude AI-generated answers altogether. In some cases, AI models can provide valuable insights and solutions to complex technical questions that might be difficult for humans to answer.

Additionally, in situations where there is a lack of human expertise on a particular topic, AI-generated answers can serve as a useful resource for users looking for information. Instead of treating AI-generated answers as the final word on a subject, we can use them as a starting point for further discussion and clarification.

Of course, it's important to carefully evaluate and verify any AI-generated responses before relying on them. But overall, I think the benefits of AI-generated answers outweigh the potential drawbacks, and I hope you'll reconsider the ban on AI answers on Stack Overflow.

Thanks for listening!

One question was about a specific situation against a specific hero. It gave advice about the situation, and advice about the hero, but not the combination of the two. And some of the advice was straight up nonsensical, which nobody seemed to notice.

The main problem with these systems is that people trust them because they are used to computers giving them answers. It's not a new problem (I'm sure it even has a technical name) but this is a worrying development, sliding further down the uncanny valley.",1,2022-12-06 02:39:58

310,,0,blind3rdeye,3297,64155,None,0,"ChatGPT is extremely impressive; but I stopped trusting it for technical accuracy when I discovered that it cannot handle ratios with fractions in them.
For example, if you tell it to simplify 3 : 2/3,   it will fail. You can explain to it where it went wrong, and maybe it you are persistent it will get it right... but if you give it another one, it will fail again.

For programming, and problem solving, there are a lot of times where the AI gets it right.

But for any tricky problem that I don't already know the answer to, I couldn't trust the AI's response; and I'd rather write it myself than debug its overly confident solution.

I imagine it would be pretty good as an API reference though.",1,2022-12-06 09:52:54
