Some prefer not using SO because the community is notorious with being toxic to newbies when asking (frequent ""duplicate"" report, RTFM comments, snarky, etc.)

Some prefer not using ChatGPT because while it solves some of your programming concerns, context-specific programming questions won't be answered directly because it would best answer things in a general approach. That's its strength tho. Just try not to ask links thi since it sucks at providing legitimate/working sources.

Some prefer not using copilot because your submitted codes would be used as training material for the ML/AI of the copilot. This is a privacy concern especially if you have a code that is not for public viewing. Some companies outright ban using AI assisted tools for programming due to this privacy and intellectual property concerns.",4,2023-09-29 05:53:07

9,,0,Individual_Dream2700,1,290,None,0,"I wonder how people get banned from SO. Because if it's really a ""noob"" question, it most probably been answered years ago already, must also be the reason people get banned.  But if people tried and never really found, maybe they were asking how to launch a rocket when the problem was why the ignition never fires.",0,2023-09-29 11:28:03

I usually use all those 3 in my recent task na ginagawa ko. kahit medyo ilabg araw bago ung deadline , natatapos ng mas maaga bciase of all tools available like AI, usually , nakahilata lang talaga after matapos ung task then pick another taak or wait sa JiRA ticket on next day or so",1,2023-10-01 11:22:42
