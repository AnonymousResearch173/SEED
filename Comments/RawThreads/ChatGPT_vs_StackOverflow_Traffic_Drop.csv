42,35,3,lightley,9,1071,None,0,"I think it can be a problem.  I have found it useful to take certification tests which have you memorize a lot of standard functions, and you will be surprised how quickly it helps you code when you don't have to stop and look basic things up.  Also, get as far as you can before you ask for help, definitely with a human being but now with the AI.  


It's important to remember than when I started coding using Visual Studio 5 (1996?), there was no intellisense (meaning the UI would not offer any suggestions for anything, so pressing a period after a class instance would not list the methods).  So after Visual Studio 6 introduced intellisense, I didn't have to memorize or look things up like before and it felt like I wasn't learning as much.  But, if you asked me to not use intellisense, I would think that is crazy.  Soon we'll have ai completion in all our code and it will be crazy not to use it.  


What I see in the future is ""normal"" people writing English sentences, and the AI writing all the code, and this will lead to no-code frameworks.  


The whole point of programming is to produce the end result and it doesn't have to be done as hard as possible, which is why we don't use c++ for everything.  So now I'll just tell stories about how back in my day, we had Visual Studio 5, and it didn't even have autocomplete, and you kids today....",1,2023-08-07 19:22:16

You can paste a function and ask it to optimize it, it will even explain why it made certain changes.

When I refer to ChatGPT not sticking around there are two possibilities. The first possibility is the restriction of AI technology. This is unlikely, as the companies who might lobby against it to preserve their profits are more likely to try and integrate it. The second option is what I referred to in the quoted reply, where public access to the technology is strangled over time with limited service models and premium subscriptions until eventually access to the tools designed to help people become more efficient and profitable become themselves an instrument of profit, at which point those businesses which don't generate enough profit will lose access and be abandoned without the ability to recover in a world where they were forced to accept that AI is mandatory and have just been denied it.

Small businesses keep money in the local economy, promote communal growth, source most of their goods from local sources further growing the local economy, and increase diversity in the local market thereby increasing its stability in the event of any single business failing.

Walmart, like every business, runs on profit incentive. By definition, this means that it will only continue to operate if it is pulling more money out of a community than it is spending on stock and wages. Walmart, as a large-scale corporation, actively prevents communal growth compared with small businesses by separating buyer from the merchant and the source of their products. Walmart sources their goods from across the nation, this means that they don't use local producers and will potentially put them out of business by offering cheaper, bulk shipped alternatives of often lower quality. And lastly, it's not guaranteed to stick around. The [poorest counties in America](https://youtu.be/p3O6bKdPLbw) all have closed down Walmarts in them that came in, outcompeted the local business in the short term, and ultimately closed their doors because the local economy didn't drive enough profit to justify keeping them open, thus resulting in near food deserts because the Walmarta closed down all the other stores and then closed themselves.",0,2023-08-06 21:24:40

When looking for deeper knowledge, a human is better. That being said, a human is not likely to want to invest the time to fix someone's wierd-ass code for them. If you take the human quirks away, you also lose the rest of the human advantage of true understanding and insight. 

At S.O. they will either evolve or die. An AI front end for searching the human curated repository is needed. And a human augmented AI to generate updates to that repository for newly developed code frameworks will also require development.
