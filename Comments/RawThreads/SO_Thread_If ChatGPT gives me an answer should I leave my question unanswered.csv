Question,"I entered this question. And in writing it out it helped me clarify what I think is the solution. So I asked ChatGPT and it agreed with my approach and provided me complete code for the solution.
This answer from ChatGPT, if entered by a human, I would accept. I am implementing this answer in my code. In addition, I'm guessing this won't be answered in SO because the number of people answering EF questions is relatively small.
So under the present rules do I leave it unanswered? Do I give the ChatGPT answer? Do I tell someone what to ask ChatGPT to get the answer?
I'm not going to post what ChatGPT answered and pretend I figured it out - that is violating the no-ChatGPT rule. Any effort I see to post the answer I have, including the suggestions in the comments, in my opinion, require either I lie or plagiarize (or both). I choose to not answer if those are my options. After all, I don't need the answer.
Update:
I posted the approach I think SO should take over in MSDN (example here). I'll do this in MSDN going forward as it's allowed there. But I think SO is poorer for not allowing entries like this.

Comment on Question,"The affinity to throw out (presumably) a good, helpful answer simply because it came from a source that is disliked is astounding and intrinsically counter-productive to the site's mission of curating a library of useful content.

Comment on Question,"“It doesn’t serve anyone well to post that inferior answer.” - Edit it so it’s no longer inferior.

Answer,"I humbly suggest that you and others in a similar situation:

Provide an answer containing any code that chatgpt generated in your answer. Provided you first verified the correctness of the code

Cite or otherwise attribute ChatGPT


AND

Provide a concise explanation of what the code does and how/why it solves the problem presented in your question.

Unless you feel you cannot provide the explanation of the code without plagiarizing the chatgpt answer.

In which case I would suggest also copy/pasting the chatgpt explanation/context (correctly attributed) ALONG WITH a concise explanation of why it is correct in this case.

Basically
I think you should create a derivative work/answer of ChatGPT's answer by providing an explanation of the generated answer OR some amount of your thoughts as to why the generated answer is valid.
why?
You can't simply post a ChatGPT answer because of the rule AND you don't want to plagiarize ChatGPT. An answer that includes an explanation and/or justification for the cited ChatGPT answer would, in my opinion, provide an answer that both:

Provides a non 100% ChatGPT answer (a human wrote the explanation and/or assurance that the answer is correct)
Is a cited, derivative (enough IMO) work that wouldn't constitute plagiarism by some definition given the context of SO

Answer,"
If ChatGPT gives me an answer, should I leave my question unanswered?

That's one of the reasons why the ban on AI-generated content is not a good idea imho. Personally, I'd post the question on Reddit or some other public place accepting AI-generated content, along with the AI-generated answer, and link to it in a comment on SO, in case someone on SO feels like paraphrasing/decorating it into an ""original"" answer (which will help train future AI systems).
