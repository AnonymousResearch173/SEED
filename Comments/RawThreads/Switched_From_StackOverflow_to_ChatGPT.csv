What are the advantages of ChatGPT? Speed and accuracy. In Stack, you can search, but you always have to filter through the results. If you ask directly, you have to wait for answers, and if there are any, they may not be correct. Also, the tone. The pedantic superiority of many answers is clearly toxic. And above all, the ability to ask again and again. However, I agree that in the long run it may make us lazier. I have regressed a lot in my mastery of English since translators do their job so well.

26,20,1,SomeWeirdoGuys,7677,3850,None,0,"Ime ChatGPT is better than Bing. Largely due to allowing me to actually send messages without having to worry about reaching the limit. Even when ChatGPT generates bad code I can just tell it what error popped up. Sometimes good preprompts help like ""For this convo let me know if what im doing is wrong, can be done in a better way, or is inefficient."" Also, I can spam files into ChatGPT and have it spit out nice code segments. 

Sadly, I haven't found any good ChatGPT based tools for it. I found one that allows you to give it a github link but only 1 prompt, no chat history. Found one that has a code editor, but it seems to be extremely slow and I want to use it with multiple files but it only supports one.",1,2023-03-07 09:32:04

Gave the same to Bing, it didn't find an error too but at least it didn't hallucinate the confusing info.

&#x200B;

Another time I've asked some question about Swift, structs and classes, copying values by reference and by value. ChatGPT gave me a wrong answer and generated a code that, as it said, would prove it right, but that code would actually prove it wrong. Bing GPT on the other hand generated a correct code and answer immediately.",2,2023-03-07 10:20:21
28,27,3,SomeWeirdoGuys,7677,3850,None,0,"When it gives false information I find it is usually because you say ""what is x"" if it doesn't know it makes it up because it was told to tell you what x is and it will now give it's best guess. As I mentioned, preprompts are useful. I believe I saw a perfect example of this on this sub, somebody asked it for a summary of an article from last year and gave it the url. It made up a summary based on the title included in the url, the summary was surprisingly accurate but was wrong. I believe it was ""Biden visits Ukraine"" or something like that.

For the swift thing, did you tell it what went wrong and give it even 1 chance to improve? I generally find that it works within 3 corrections (beyond that it likely won't work on its own unless it's getting new error messages) then depth look through fixes it's code. Generally for corrections if it is data changing I just say ""oi this data ain't right, for example you didn't do x and you did y"" then feed it the data. Or give it a complete error message.

While the above are slightly annoying I find a (currently) 8 chat limit to be far more annoying. I can just feed it all the files relevant to what I am working on and ask questions, add what I want, then later pick it up without any issues. With bing if I am working on a few files I gotta waste several prompts then be careful about my question as I can't edit it.",1,2023-03-07 10:31:34

31,,0,uluvboobs,3724,43426,None,0,"Yeh but sometimes it can lead you down a rabbit hole. 

Spent a few hours yesterday trying to sort an async text stream from python using Flask. I had used GPT really well to get the project going, generating bash, dockerfiles, python boilerplates, that i would then ask it to fill out. everything ""worked"", even writing tests for my code. 

I spent hours trying to get the stream to work using GPT as the guide. After a while I did some thinking, and figured out there's a lot more to async than I know. For hours it just kept  pumping out solutions that didn't work, and I knew wouldn't work, very frustrating. 

It never once suggested to use another library, that I can't do what I want, or explain how what I was doing wrong in more broad terms, only my ""traditional"" knowledge let me know to stop and think things through.

I definitely use it as my go-to first time I search for an answer though on some things.

I find ChatGPT struggles with Regular Expressions when parsing strings for data and it often kicks out completely nonsense answers that have kind of a glimmer of being ""almost right,"" but oh so confidently incorrect.

On the other hand, it helped me realize that there were some tools built into some languages that I wasn't using by the code demo it uses, and I was like ""Wait, really, I can do that in a for loop?"" or something like that.
