6,5,3,No-Champion-2194,1,8323,None,0,"Agreed.  I finally deleted my account.  My experience was looking for an answer regarding date handling in SQL Server.  I found a relevant post and an answer that worked fine, part of it was using DATEPART(hh...).  A moderator comes in to the thread and changes it to DATEPART(HOUR...).  The poster comes back and complains that his original answer was correct and documented as proper syntax and shouldn't have been edited.  The mod comes then berates the poster for not knowing the 'best' way to write the query.

On the site, I saw a question from an obviously junior developer who was struggling to write a query, but was clearly trying to learn.  I pointed out an obvious typo in his query, and explained what he should do without burying him in jargon.  I then get berated for responding to a question that wasn't properly stated, and told that I shouldn't guess that he made a typo.  Refusing to help a struggling dev because he didn't get his question right really shows the worst tendencies of the developer community.  I need to keep this in mind and be sure to be more patient with devs asking me for help.

As a result, it's a wonderful tool for asking any kind of question ( as you say, they're no pressure, no judgement when we're conversing with an AI ), except that it can answer useless or wrong things, which is particularly troublesome for code.

Moreover, I think that if we stop using SO, the site will eventually die, and in that case how can AIs remain effective if such sources disappear ?

Because of this I don't like to see some people impliying SO is becoming obsolete, because without this site I think the results would have a hard time being accurate (when they are).",1,2024-02-09 14:29:45

Stack overflow is a decent way to find the best practices on things or surface level information about unfamiliar topics. But once you're actually down in the weeds and trying to solve a difficult problem neither GPT nor SO help. Github discussions can be great and documentation sometimes has your answers hidden away somewhere.
