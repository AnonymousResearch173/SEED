Ask a travel question on /r/Travel and unless you are coming up with something incredibly novel or the mob-mind gods are on your side at that moment you're going to be downvoted. And from their perspective it's because ""we see this same question 10 times a day"" but from the person asking the question's perspective it might be a genuinely new take on that question. Also to be fair to the sub 9 times out of 10 it genuinely is a question that you could find on Google quickly.

However, you start going into niche subs you can get friendly helpful people because they are just happy you're there. 

I'm sure if you go onto the /r/PHP5_6_2 subreddit and ask a question that's actually related to PHP 7 they are going to be like ""oh actually this sub is dedicated to PHP5.6.2 but here is how you can fix your mysqli\_ function, also you should consider using PDO"". 

Stackoverflow gets so many dumb questions a day they have a choice, put the onus on new people to ""get good"" at asking for help or make the existing more experienced users more frustrated who have already shown their dedication to the platform.

67,66,6,Deleted,N/A,N/A,None,0,"Technically GPT doesn't know about anything. It's not AI. It's predicting a response - one word at a time - based on what you type for the prompt. Sure, topical questions will be out of date - but they always were anyway.

I know there is internet search capability but we're talking about what it was trained on and could predict successfully. So the question in my mind isn't so much - is GPT out of date, but rather - is accuracy in the predicted response diminished by how recent the themes are, or the way we've asked the question?

In some respects, the specific content we're seeking (asking about news and or scientific breakthroughs), could be out of date. But the way we ask questions and a lot of the information we seek hasn't really changed. There are an awful lot of things you can ask which will remain the same and likely work under previously trained data (general logic, crafting different types of replies, suggesting recipes, formatting, coding, analysis, etc).

Don't ask GPT to do something like count the syllables in words, or name who the current secretary or energy is (it might get it right but that's not the point). There are quicker and easier ways to get that sort of factual information and you're wasting your time if that's how you're using it.
