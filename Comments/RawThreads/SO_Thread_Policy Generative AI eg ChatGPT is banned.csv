Moderator Note: This post has been locked to prevent comments because people have been using them for protracted debate and discussion (we've deleted over 300 comments on this post alone, not even including its answers).
The comment lock is not meant to suppress discussion or prevent users from expressing their opinions. You are (as always) encouraged to vote on this post to express your agreement/disagreement. If you want to discuss this policy further, or suggest other related changes, please Ask a New Question and use the ai-generated-content tag.

All use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT1 and other LLMs) is banned when posting content on Stack Overflow.
This includes ""asking"" the question to an AI generator then copy-pasting its output as well as using an AI generator to ""reword"" your answers.
Please see the Help Center article: What is this site’s policy on content generated by generative artificial intelligence tools?
Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies is too low, the posting of content created by ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking questions and looking for correct answers.
The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies produce have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like the answers might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting. Because such answers are so easy to produce, a large number of people are posting a lot of answers. The volume of these answers (thousands) and the fact that the answers often require a detailed read by someone with significant subject matter expertise in order to determine that the answer is actually bad has effectively swamped our volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure.
As such, we need to reduce the volume of these posts and we need to be able to deal with the ones which are posted quickly, which means dealing with users, rather than individual posts.
So, the use of ChatGPT or other generative AI technologies to create posts or other content here on Stack Overflow is not permitted. If a user is believed to have used ChatGPT or other generative AI technologies after the posting of this policy, sanctions will be imposed to prevent them from continuing to post such content, even if the posts would otherwise be acceptable.
NOTE: While the above text focuses on answers, because that's where we're experiencing the largest volume of such content, the ban applies to all content on Stack Overflow, except each user's profile content (e.g., your ""About me"" text).

Historical context of this ban originally being ""temporary""
When this ban was originally posted on 2022-12-05, it was explicitly stated as a ""Temporary policy"". It was specifically ""temporary"", because it was, at that time, a policy which was being imposed by the subset of moderators who were present on the site over the weekend after the announcement of ChatGPT's public release, 2022-11-30, through the Monday, 2022-12-05, when this question was posted. The moderators involved strongly felt that we didn't have the right to impose a permanent policy in this manner upon the site, but did have a responsibility to impose a temporary policy that was necessary in order for the site to remain functioning while discussion was had, consensus reached, and also allowed Stack Overflow, the company, time to have internal discussions to see what policies they would adopt network wide. So, after consultation with the company, the moderators present at that time chose to implement this as a ""temporary"" policy.
Since then, quite a lot has happened. Based on the voting for this question, it's clear that there's an overwhelming consensus for this policy. The company has chosen that the specific policy on AI-generated content will be up to individual sites (list of per-site policies), but that even on sites which permit AI-generated content, such AI-generated content is considered ""not your own work"" and must follow the referencing requirements. The requirement for following the referencing requirements was, later, put into the Code of Conduct: Inauthentic usage policy. There's a lot more that's gone on with respect to AI-generated content. So much has happened such that it's not reasonable to try to summarize all of it here.

1. ChatGPT is an Artificial Intelligence based chat bot by OpenAI, which was announced on 2022-11-30. Use of ChatGPT is currently available to the public without monetary payment.

Answer,"It's 2024. I visited 3 pages of answers. None contains the buzzword ""copyright"".
I'm just trying to contribute in the first message of this thread, to try to add a mention that this is not ""just"" a community policy about being precise or not; the ban reasons should also stress more about being a needed moral and legal proactive measure, to avoid additional plagiarisms and copyright infringements.

LLMs causes extra Copyright and Credit Nightmares
Popular large language models are like Pandora's pots, trained over millions and millions of obscure copyrighted materials, and this can surely cause extra potential copyright violations and plagiarism that can be tricky to be proactively identified, to assure long life to the Stack Exchange network, distant from boring extra lawsuits and extra mass ""content takedown"" requests.
Because LLMs Do Not Give Authorship Credits
Even taking copyright apart; popular LLMs do not mention the author, so they do not respect moral rights, and they do not fulfill our sane referencing standards.
https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/referencing
...for Technical Reasons
No known popular large language model was currently designed to give you the original sources. A ""generic human"" can tell you who taught to sum 1 plus 1: they can find their early Math school book and find out which page of that book says so. LLMs, instead, are trained differently, and cannot just give references in the expected way.
Some advanced LLMs acts like are able to give you references, but if you pay attention, even these are ""just"" capable to share ""further information"", and only after whatever text is generated (e.g. Microsoft Copilot, ...).
...for Political Reasons
Moreover, popular LLMs usually do not even share the original dataset on their website (and this is a political issue, not a technical issue; as the dataset can be shared in whatever moment, especially from organizations that have ""Open"" and ""AI"" in their official name).
Indeed this practice of closing the dataset does not simplify the backward work of finding the right credit to a generated text.
Because we are supposed to release in CC BY-SA 4.0
Premising that, as I hope everyone already noted, in every single page of the Stack Exchange Network, there is this phrase at the footer of the website:

Site design / logo © 2024 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under CC BY-SA.

Please take 60 seconds to read this page, if it's your first time:
https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing
It just means that new contents must be covered by these terms:
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
(Again please take additional 60 seconds to read this ↑)
Also note that there is not any ""unless otherwise noted"" in the above SE copyright terms.
TL;DR
Both the Stack Exchange Inc. and the SE community have probably no sufficient time to fight this additional copyright risk, and moral risks, of giving no sufficient credits to original content authors.
The potentially high benefits do not outweigh the potentially very very very high risks, especially without enforcing an extra care and awareness.
Next Steps?

SE policy lacks an ""unless otherwise noted""

At the moment the copyright terms of SE does not mention the phrase ""unless otherwise noted"". That phrase is quite useful, since our planet has billions of contents under thousands of licenses, and very often answers are like ""«bla bla bla» very long snippet citation1 citation2 citation3"" and indeed this kind of answers are not content under CC BY-SA 4.0, but are instead contents released under the terms of the upstream copyright holder. Usually, official code snippets are pasted here on Stack Overflow as answer but just as mention, to quickly find that upstream documentation. So indeed, with or without AI-generated contents, a global ""unless otherwise noted"" would probably help in quoting external contents (ChatGPT included I guess...).


Evaluate ""fair use"" policies

If you know what you are doing, small use of proprietary sources can be used even if they are ""all rights reserved"". But, you must clarify that the content is not yours, and you should clarify the reasons why you believe that the content can be shared in ""fair use"". Note that the Wikipedia community has interesting ""fair use"" policies. Instead the community of Wikimedia Commons does not generally include contents in fair use. But clarifying such policy in our website may be necessary, sooner or later, with ad without AI; and with and without AI contents that are assumed under ""all rights reserved"" as default.


Evaluate big disclaimers about AI-generated contents

Basically stuff like https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-algorithm that it's currently embedded in some multimedia files, to say that «This file is in the public domain because it is the work of a computer algorithm or artificial intelligence and does not contain sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim. The United Kingdom and Hong Kong provide a limited term of copyright protection for computer-generated works of 50 years from creation. 1 2».



So, I think the current ban is OK. Before even discussing a re-activation, we should at least afford the above points, to improve the legal safe space for editors but also readers, and use this kind of tools in a legal way.

Answer,"I've given a lot of time before writing this because I think at this point we all have been able to digest and rationalize what is happening around this phenomena.
First of all, I fully agree with the temporary policy, and I am in favor that it becomes a ""permanent temporary"" one.
The main reason I'm on that opinion is not the fact of the tool being available, but the way so many people were using it: as a copy-pastable BS generator for social networking engagement (in our case, SO reputation). This alone spawns several reasons for why it should be banned, but I don't have to point them out anymore, as it should be common knowledge right now.
I am not in favour of computer-aided code writing as a tool to show examples of how a particular question can be solved. That is a job for GitHub Copilot or other places, not for this website. People can go straight to GPT-3's playground and ask the program to write code for them as an additional reference, but Stack Overflow should remain as human-aided different points of view in a given problem in the form of a question.

On the other hand:
I would like to add to the debate ""legitimate"" use of the technology. Consider some people who are savvy on the topic of the community (in our case, programming), but they are not proficient in the use of English or in a general sense, for whatever reason, haven't developed very good communication abilities.
Would you consider the potential contributions of such a person less valuable than another one who can express themselves ""better"" (in the sense of getting their point across close to the most optimal possible way)?
Now take the conclusion you've reached by reading the last two paragraphs and let's see what professionals of the marketing area are doing. They're using ChatGPT as a tool for computer-aided writing. Sure, the lazy ones are just copying and pasting whatever the program spits out, but in the hands of a capable professional, ChatGPT is much more powerful and is faster than hours of googling, which is what they were doing until now.
Also, that is what we programmers were doing until now. Of course, our main sources of inspiration are probably Stack Overflow, but there's a lot of forums around. Just like Server Fault users rely mostly on Server Fault, but the ArchWiki is still a reliable curated source of information, among other wikis and forums. But we all became dependent on search engines like Google Search.
Come to think about it, it came as no particular surprise to me that Microsoft decided to integrate ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.
There is a specific ELI5 prompt on the ChatGPT API examples page that try to show how to use the power of synthetic dialectics to further clarify a subject. The job of a communicator is to find the best words in the best order to exchange an idea to a specific target group. And in that field, ChatGPT is not a terrific tool, but it can aid many people as it is right now.

My point is that computer-assisted writing is a beneficial thing. People can use it to write better questions primarily, but also improve their answers' wording. This is specially useful for the handful of people I've described earlier: the ones proficient in programming, but not as much in writing English, or in communicating in general.
The distinction between computer-assisted writing and copy pasting from a BS generator should be obvious.
I could send this whole answer to proof reading humans or ChatGPT and bet excellent feedback from the humans, but reasonable good feedback from the program. It would look less like I'm the author of it, but in both cases, you, the reader, would struggle less to understand what I want to tell you. DISCLAIMER: I did neither. This is 100% my first take on writing the answer, without revision.
Finally, my opinion is that people should somehow feel that it's ok to use computer programs to aid their writing. I'm not sure how the anti GPT policy could be further improved to include this, or if is it even necessary.
I will repeat this paragraph from the beginning, now that the reader has a new perspective:
I am not in favour of computer-aided code writing as a tool to show examples of how a particular question can be solved. That is a job for GitHub Copilot or other places, not for this website. People can go straight to GPT-3's playground and ask the program to write code for them as an additional reference, but Stack Overflow should remain as human-aided different points of view in a given problem in the form of a question.

Answer,"I was reading this post extensively and I'm really worried by the reactions.
The first thing I remembered was cab driver's reaction when Uber came to my town. They reacted extremely angrily. They got together, persecuted Uber drivers. They used lawfare and political connections against Uber drivers, and they got to physical fights with Uber drivers to the point Uber drivers initially couldn't reveal themselves when they picked up a client because cab drivers where constantly looking for them and picking fights with them and their clients.
This scenery lasted a couple of months until they realized the inevitability of their fate. Some cab corporations even tried to educate cab drivers to give candies and treat client the best way possible. Nothing could resist Uber and today there are very few cab drivers resisting in my town.
Now when I read this thread I notice some very worrying trends:
First the level of ChatGPT answers on this matter (most upvoted answers) just shows how advanced it is. The sarcastic answer was terrifying.
Second, I saw that most people see the ban as the correct option, without having a reasonable way of distinguishing AI-generated answers from human answers. I think there are only two possible ways: letting users decide if it's an AI generated answer or having direct help from OpenAI itself. But I really don't think that humans will have the ability to tell one from the other. That leaves us with the only option of asking OpenAI for help. Has anyone contacted them yet?
Then the level of harshness with those who advocated ChatGPT integration (most downvoted answers) only reinforced the memory of cab drivers reaction. This worries me the most because disruptive technologies have to be embraced from the start or things will only get worse.
Adding to this is a very compelling pro-AI factor: the fact that some users are really fed up with aggressive answers from humans in SO and would much rather prefer to interact with a AI that treated them good. This is getting so critical that some people left SO altogether. I live in Brazil and I don't use the Portuguese SO because of extreme rudeness I got there several times. English SO is less bad, but I can assure you that if there were any other options people would embrace them in a heartbeat.
Just like I and many other people were fed up by cab drivers unethical attitudes like trying to figure out if the users knew the town so they could make a longer paths to the destination, not giving correct change, rudeness and many other things. That made Uber irresistible. As soon as it was available I never ever used a cab again. Since the first day it was on town.
Finally, remember that ChatGPT is learning and its answers will only get better and better. What are wrong or bad answers now will probably be the best answers in the future.
My advice (which will make my answer quickly get to most downvoted): If we can't get OpenAI to help, integration with ChatGPT is the only possible option. Create a clearly labeled automated answer for each post from ChatGPT and let users downvote it if it's bad as with any normal user.
This way users will have an immediate answer they know was AI generated and they will know there is a greater risk of being wrong, just like we know with automated translations of text.
I know this will be unpopular because it will make more difficult to build reputation points, especially if ChatGPT improves its answers. It's still better than losing all SO or making fruitless attempts to differentiate AI answers from human answers.
Any other option will not stand this test.
Maybe this means that some time in the near future SO will be no longer relevant because you can just ask an AI what the problem is with no need for human interaction. Well, if that is the case SO is already doomed and needs to rethink its business model from the scratch. If that's the case, it's better to embrace it as soon as possible. Humans can always help with comments and corrections at least while it still generates wrong or bad answers. But if it gets really good at it, there is no possible future for SO.
If you can't beat them, join them - a popular proverb.
Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated - Borgs.

Answer,"LLMs are trained on data from sites like SO. What do you think is going to happen when they're going to train LLMs on content created by LLM?

LLMs do not really understand the topic. They only understand relations between words. They don't really have insight in the subjects described by the text. If we're going to post LLM-generated content here on SO, over years it will lead to the latest more advanced LLMs being trained on data produced by early simple LLMs (potentially without being verified by someone with actual insight).
Some might argue it's possible to prevent this using voting for/against the posts. But how can you be sure the LLMs are not voting as well? Also casting a vote does not require the voter to explain why he/she votes the way he/she does, nor to prove his/her insight.

Answer,"I fully respect the rules of Stack Overflow, but I want to highlight how technology, including language models like LLMs, plays a crucial role in the empowerment of people with disabilities. The goal of rights and regulations should be to promote a positive evolution of society. As a proof of transparency, wouldn't it be better to specify that a response has been assisted by an LLM?
Could we not offer an honest prompt for all Dys for example?

Thank you all for your comments. You can understand that for those who don't grasp how generative intelligence offers a significant advantage in terms of compensation for language disorders, if in the future the major evolution of artificial intelligence does not allow a site like Stack Overflow to make a difference, it is necessary in my opinion to accompany the transition and make it as transparent as possible.
It is obvious that many developers use generative algorithms without saying so, and with their improvement, it is quite possible that it will be difficult to detect them. Note that the fact that you have used an artificial intelligence is important data for future algorithms that will use the data generated by Stack Overflow.
Moreover, in language disorders for example, the contribution of artificial intelligence, with tools like generative AI, allows for a great improvement in language quality. It should be noted that many people in the world of science have this type of disorder, from Moses to Thomas Edison to Leonardo da Vinci, Einstein.
For this reason, I think it is not good to prohibit the use of generative artificial intelligence, particularly for disability and for the future evolution of this type of technology, and that it is more judicious to mention it. I understand that some people will never do it, but ethics is an individual question. Should everyone be punished for the fault of some and not others?

Answer,"Preface
In the past when searching for the answer to some problem with your favorite search engine, you could easily find the same answer many times, even though it was obviously wrong (not working).
That was (I suspect) due to the fact that many users just copied answers from elsewhere without citing where they got it from, or due to ""re-framing"", that is, some site just placed a new frame and some advertising around another site. Fortunately, the latter have vanished mostly meanwhile.
ChatGPT
I think ChatGPT and alike are impressive, but there are still severe problems:
I have a (seemingly simple) programming problem that I couldn’t solve myself reading the documentation, so I used Google to search for solutions. I had tried a few, but none worked, so I tried ChatGPT.
ChatGPT provided a ""solution"" that looked similar to the ones I had seen before, but actually it didn't work either.
So I told it that the solution did not work, and ChatGPT provided me with another ""solution"" (that also did not work).
I think the above clearly shows the problem with ChatGPT:
It cannot tell where it got its wisdom from, and the answers may be incorrect without ChatGPT knowing.
Any use?
Still, I could imagine (monetary and legal issues left aside) that SO integrates ChatGPT for newly asked (or to be asked) questions:

It could be used to find similar (equivalent) questions before posting the question.  I saw many questions about the same problem (like ""find string X in input Y""), where the posters were unable to abstract the problem to the root problem, not even partially.
It could suggest an ""answer"" before posting the question: If ChatGPT could provide a correct answer, there isn't any need to post the question on SO (maybe because the question is rather trivial also).

Answer,"In your reasoning for the general ban on ""All use of generative AI"", you have not explained how it could be ""harmful"" to the website if a user verifies an AI-generated answer for correctness before posting it (for example by testing the code), or partially uses it in reaching their own correct answer.
In other words, if the problem is the curation and moderation of bad answers, why limit the ways good answers can be generated? With the AI-generated content becoming more accurate every day, (a) even human experts are more likely to provide better and quicker answers if they use AI for assistance, (b) it will be increasingly hard to detect AI use in part or all of an answer, and (c) it will be easier for this platform to actually use AI to find and flag potentially bad/incorrect answers, whether generated by humans or AI, for human experts to review.
Therefore it seems more logical to help the ""swamped volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure"" by actually using AI to prioritize the reviewed content, and to utilize other hard solutions such as limiting the posting frequency, rather than announcing general bans that could end up being hypocritical and impossible to enforce.

Comment on Answer,"There is no way to make sure the poster did verify it, and there is no way to make sure LLMs have not been used in part or all of the answer. You can only verify the answer itself for correctness, and LLMs can help with that. There are many studies on the use of LLMs for fact checking.

Comment on Answer,"@RyanM The verification responsibility is on the poster. Yes, definitely ban the ""10-second blind copy-pasted answers from ChatGPT"", but that's not what this ban says.

Comment on Answer,"@FNia Please cite sources for your claims (especially the claim that LLMs can probabilistically classify the truth of answers).  Our overwhelming experience is that current LLM technology cannot reliably do any of those things, at least within the domain to which it's being applied here.  If we enter a world in which the way people use LLMs does not generate large quantities of plausible-looking incorrect information, then we may reconsider the ban.  That is not the world we live in, however; thus, the ban.",Ryan M,20167,7,1,2024-02-15 00:03:39
Comment on Answer,"@markalex Do you understand what it means to ""understand"", before making any claim about LLMs' understanding? And does it matter if a calculator ""understands"" numbers, as long it produces correct answers? Depending on the model quality and task at hand, LLMs can be very likely to produce correct and useful outputs (so a blanket ban on them is nonsensical) and they can probabilistically classify other answers to be true or false.

Comment on Answer,"The problem with ""verify them"" is that the amount of time, effort, and expertise it takes to verify an answer is often multiple orders of magnitude greater than the 10 seconds the poster spent blindly copy-pasting the question into ChatGPT.

Answer,"On the flipside?
I would like to argue that there is one class of AI writing that should be explicitly allowed.
Specifically, when an AI like ChatGPT gets a series of questions for which it cannot produce adequate answers,  the AI should produce a composite question about it.  This should also include statements of why it doesn't consider its own answers adequate.  This should then be asked here, as an official post from the AI (as in the user might be ""ChatGPT"" or the like).
The point here is to increase the corpus of knowledge.

Having said all that,  I do believe that answers or questions pasted from ChatGPT or the like should be banned.

Answer,"I, personally, think that there's not much we, as a community, can do to stop AI-generated content from being used on the site in the long term.  Furthermore, I think that the long-term is what we should be focusing on.
The future of AI in a different timeline
The current banhammer stopgap may work for now, but it's a simple solution requiring manpower, and it won't be viable forever.  Who here remembers when Dragon Naturally Speaking came out on CD in the 90s?  I was 8 or 9 when my grandfather got us a copy.  We had an old beige microphone, and my friends and family were absolutely amazed at the speech recognition capability.  They could dictate documents directly into Microsoft Works, and I could....  Well...  Do what 9-year-olds do best:  See how many curse words it could recognize... Even if you had to enunciate them.
Fast forward a couple of years and the same software could recognize multiple individuals in a single conversation and create a transcript including respective speakers.  Fast forward a few more years and Microsoft has added ""Train your computer to better understand you""1, so enunciation is no longer an obstacle.
That 10-year timespan I just covered would be easy to react to as a community.  The problem is AI doesn't take 10 years, it takes 10 hours2.  It's easy to spot right now (question rephrased to statement followed by bullet points for your vanilla ChatGPT) but what happens when we get the option to ""Train your computer to better type like you""?  The Insider Build of Windows 11 (Dev Channel) currently has a Copilot preview that can access your active tab3.  I'm certain Microsoft Office access will be next, so It's only a few steps away at most in my opinion.
My opinion moving forward
My thought is this...  The banhammer on AI-generated content that isn't cited should continue.  However, we should move towards a system that accepts it, so long as it's clearly marked/cited as machine generated4 and there should rarely, if ever, be a top answer marked that is wholly AI-generated.  As we move towards that system, the 30-day bans need to turn into 90-day bans.  If we incorporate automated detection at some point, it should be human-reviewed, and 90 days should turn into 180 days.  I do not see this as too harsh of a punishment so long as users have been explicitly warned.
I believe that if history (as a whole) has shown us anything, it's that we cannot simply ignore a problem, sweep it under the run, and expect it to go away.  Band-aids are temporary, but AI is not.  Humans have suppressed so many different things over the years...  Catholics persecuted Presbyterians as heretics in the Middle Ages, Americans in the land of the free bought and sold black slaves to tend their households and farmlands, women were expected to quietly obey their husbands without a voice to vote until the 1900s, and Jews...  Well, Jews have gotten the shaft since the dawn of time.
I'm not saying that AI deserves citizenship or human rights[5].  But as widespread as AI will inevitably become, and as integrated into our lives as it will we need to treat it that way.
TLDR:
We should standardize a boilerplate for AI content and require anyone incorporating it into their content to use it.  We should continue the 30-day ban stopgap until a point where it's no longer needed. We should work towards a way of automating the recognition of AI-generated content that isn't cited, always require human review of this automation's output to reduce false positives and implement very steep consequences for those who violate the rules.
Again, all of this is just my opinion.  I've been a lurker for 7 years, but as you can see from my reputation, I haven't been active until this past week (I've started to enjoy teaching and tutoring in IT).  So, in the grand scheme of things, my 2 cents is literally just that, 2 cents.  But I hope that at least a few of you will share somewhat similar opinions.  Thanks for your time :)
Clarification on long-term viability and manpower
I do not necessarily think there will be a need to patrol AI-generated content forever.  At least, I hope there isn't...  However, dumping everything into implementing 30-day bans as stopgaps can't be the answer.  Because if we're relying on humans to recognize AI-generated content, we will fail no matter what.  I'm not necessarily saying we should absolutely do anything specific.  I'm only saying that we need to look much further ahead than much of the discussion going on here.
I do not know what technology drives Stack Exchange on the backend.  But the technology has to move forward to account for AI content.  Whether you call this a forum, a wiki, an image board, a social media network, or anything else...  The technology underneath needs to move forward. To stress this point again if we're relying on humans to recognize AI-generated content, we're going to fail no matter what
What's stopping users from simply not adding the boilerplate?
As Stack Overflow is built on a foundation of user trust, there's nothing that can be done to prevent this except moderating content. Though, in my opinion, adding the boilerplate at least lets the userbase know it's expected.  I found out via a comment warning when skimming through questions.
But AI content can't reliably be detected?
I'm not asking for someone to look into this or share information related to site analytics or any other privileged information.  However, I would postulate that greater than 65% of users who have been banned for posting AI generated content are newer users trying to boost their reputation.  Furthermore, I would estimate that greater than 80% of those are using a vanilla ChatGPT based AI, of which greater than 95% are ""non-precise"" style (This high percentage is based on the difficulty of getting a reliable output to open ended questions.)
I want to point out an assumption in my argument. I'm looking at this from the point of view that if you know enough about AI to use anything outside of what's available on the mainstream channels, you likely have the experience to answer the questions without using AI content or to examine the content for accuracy before posting it.  As mentioned in the previous section, I am basing this assumption off the foundation of trust.
If those numbers are remotely close, then the additional review queue should not require much additional overhead to patrol a large portion of violations. I can quite easily imagine a natural language string analysis algorithm combined with a user event timing algorithm that could pick out a relatively high percentage of violations.  I'm sure there are many users way more talented than myself who could imagine the same in a far more optimized and efficient way.
An alternative
If patrolling content and review queues are too far-fetched, then maybe instead of targeting users, we should target posts (I thought this was mentioned in one of the comment threads, but I couldn't find it on a second look).  Automated boilerplate addition to user posts if they are flagged as AI generated by an algorithm.  A certain reputation level allows an individual to remove the boilerplate.  A higher reputation level will automatically bypass the check on their posts.

If policing content isn't the answer, then decriminalization and regulation is.

[2] Keep in mind that AI can't just pick up any task and do it quicker and better.  Take for instance the following study in which it took an AI 924 hours to learn a game that would take humans less than 30 minutes:

[4] We should probably require citing the exact AI that generated it.  I foresee that as an upcoming IP battle in the near future.  Plus, as always, there are going to be biases on AI sources that could affect the community as a whole if we don't.
[5] Yet...  But I can't convince myself to rule that out at some point in the future, the human brain is only so complex, and technology is surely, albeit slowly, getting there.

Answer,"I have questions from ChatGPT and some of the answers were 100% accurate. Now Stack Overflow should allow accurate and acceptable answers from AI. It can save a lot of time.
It has come to experience that the logic, queries (MySQL and MongoDB) can take up to 12 hours. ChatGPT has answered and created queries like that in just seconds. (I have pro ChatGPT.) I have created an API that has multiple if-else and multiple queries with more than 500 lines of code (2000 ms response time), but with the help of ChatGPT, I have done that API with just 20 lines of code, with an average response time of 500 ms.
Now is the time to use ChatGPT and such platforms to speed up the development process. ChatGPT is really helpful to newcomers and for developing small-scale logic and functions.

Answer,"Reading through the answers and comments, I can't help but detect a lot of bias, seemingly out of fear for the unknown or potential competitor.
This line in the OP is telling:

in order to determine that the answer is actually bad has effectively swamped our volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure.

Why set out to determine it 'is actually bad' instead of good. In my experience, it's usually correct (because I ask the right questions). In the cases it's not, it's useful to discuss with ChatGPT where the mistake lies. With some frequency I ask it to reread its reply and whether it is sure that's correct.
Similar in many comments, where people clearly show bias without supporting or even convincing arguments. Comments like ""it is stupid"" and ""it's a good joke generator"". The main argument seems to be ""it's not always correct"". Yes, neither are all (or even most?) human answers, but that aside, if that's your main argument, what will you do in 6 months or 2 years?
Personally I think ChatGPT is hands down the most productive assistant / near-coworker I ever had (in 30+ years IT and coding) and anyone not adapting it ASAP to gain at least experience with it is contributing to their own demise.
Important to understand is that it's an assistant, a tool, not a substitute. AI won't replace developers; developers who use AI will replace developers. Pick a side that suits you and your family. Sticking your head in the sand isn't a fruitful approach to AI, embrace it, control it, use it to increase productivity.
Posting answers or questions written by ChatGPT straight to SO is like copying and pasting from another site, but banning questions and answers ChatGPT assisted in writing just seems wrong. It's almost like banning a spell/grammar checker.
I learned never to complain without offering alternatives. People posting answers should be held accountable for bad answers. That way they'll put in the extra effort to make sure the AI-assistant answer is useful to the one asking the question. Whether it's text, questions and answers, or code, everything an AI produces should be considered a draft. Perhaps a test section limited to certain topics, or show the ChatGPT-assisted answers (allow answerers to mark them as such) at the bottom of the answer list, collapsed and hidden till the reader opens them.

Answer,"My take on AI-generated answers is this:
Using ChatGPT and similar services is very easy. It's comparable to Google Translate. If you want an AI-generated answer, then you simply use one of those services.
Compare to the language sites. If you ask for a translation, then what you're looking for is something else than what Google Translate produces. If you wanted something from there, then you would use that service instead of asking on a forum.
I think it's good to assume that a user who is asking a question on a forum has tried those easy-to-use services and found them unsatisfying. Note that I'm not saying that it is likely that they have done it. Just that it is good to assume it, in the sense that you should answer a question as if ChatGPT or Google Translate was not enough for the asker.

Answer,"As GPT-4 is available for $20/month, shouldn't you rewrite your policy?

ChatGPT is actually training. Given the fact that it gives wrong code (sometimes), it is normal to not accept answers exclusively written by the AI.
But this is only the beginning.
You are at the same point that chess players were when computer engines entered the board and started to play chess at a human level.
Chess adapted to engines, and Stack Overflow should adapt to AI coding systems, perhaps develop its own AI system (they have the site content to train its project; they could open it as an account subject to human democracy).
A few decades later, the chess engines have an Elo rating of 3300, while Magnus Carlsen is rated 2900, so there will come a day when users will prefer to ask their code problems from an AI rather than a human (maybe soon). This will rid the site of bad questions that are not well-received and not answered. It will also help the site to evaluate its own content to detect errors (perhaps adding a warning: ""The AI has detected a problem in this answer"").
There still are chess players who would prefer that there weren't any engines, but by now chess engines have become friends of most chess players.
The AI coding systems should also become a friend of the community of programmers.
You are complaining about a first attempt, ChatGPT, the first project open to the public. It is important that AI is available for everybody, including the programming community.

Answer,"Why not have all new questions include an automated answer by an official Stack Overflow ChatGPT account, with a clear indication that this is the ChatGPT response? Maybe even show the user the ChatGPT answer before the question is posted, to reduce duplicate/low-quality questions.
This way, it just gets the ChatGPT controversy out of the way... ironically, by embracing it. If the answer works, then great. If it doesn't work, well now at least there is a Stack Overflow sanctioned answer written by ChatGPT to compare new answers against. But if there's already a ChatGPT answer, why would anyone answer it with another ChatGPT answer?
If the problem is users abusing questions with quick, low quality answers... well that's a different problem; those users will always exist.

Comment on Answer,"I don't get where you people are getting ""the ChatGPT answer"". There are multiple requests for this but they all fail at that point because ChatGPT doesn't give one answer. It generates statistically plausible text which can be different answers. Even if we assume that SO will show a ChatGPT answer at asking time and/or after posting a question, that answer need not be the same as you'd get from generating again. The claim that it would discourage others from posting a ChatGPT generated answer is basically unbacked by anything as it's not just the same text spewed out.",VLAZ,29086,27,0,2023-03-30 04:44:51

Answer,"Instead of banning ChatGPT, Stack Overflow could consider adding a new button ""Show AI Generated Answer(s)"" to each question page. Such answers should be hidden by default, but if anybody is curious about what ChatGPT (or any other future AI tool of the day) has to say about it, they can check it out.
Also, such AI-generated answers could be compared to the ""human""-generated answers with another AI tool to compute a similarity score, and if a ""human""-generated answer is too similar to an AI-generated one, then such an answer should be banned (since the probability that such ""human"" answer has actually been produced using an AI tool would be high) and the user who posted it could be given some penalty.
So, this approach would kill two birds with one stone - people would be much less likely to post AI-generated answers since such answers would already be there automatically, and Stack Overflow would get an automated tool for detecting AI-generated answers and for punishing users who abuse the ""no AI-generated answers"" policy.

Answer,"Yes, it should be banned.  To the question of ""How do we identify those posts?"", it should be considered that this problem is not new or unique to Stack Overflow.  Plagiarism is a concern that spans broadly.  An answer found in academia is to copy/paste answers back into ChatGPT and see if it responds to it as a continuation of a conversation; if it does, then flag it as AI-generated.
This is a potential technique, and one that scales.  Multiple suggestions here imply that ""you can tell it by looking at it"", which isn't all that helpful because we can't expect people to reliably keep up with the potentially exponential flow of spam answers.

Answer,"After several months, I noticed a big difference between the question-and-answer websites that allow and those that prohibit ChatGPT. I used to use a website (called Jingyi forum(精易论坛)), which used to be good because it enabled me to communicate more easily (as English is my second language).
I asked a question about C++ on that website recently. However, after I posted my question, the only one who answered my question was using ChatGPT. What surprised me even more was the administrator did not ban him even though the answer is completely wrong. Comparing Stack Overflow with that website, I can get better answers in a shorter amount of time on Stack Overflow.
What's more, people on that website, who tried to help people, have started to not be willing to answer questions. They take a long time to write an answer to a question, but they can get less reward than those who use ChatGPT.

Answer,"Additional cases for permanent ban of answers
In addition to completely agreeing with this for all the reasons already stated in the other answers, and also feeling like it should be permanent (also for reasons stated many times elsewhere), I think there is an additional case for making it a permanent ban that I don't see covered elsewhere:
Under the presumption that anybody can just go to a public GPT instance, type their question, and get a similar (if not identical) answer, then allowing those answers to be posted on SE sites essentially means two things:

It means, to some extent, that the question itself lacked research: If it was that easy to get an answer (ask a bot) then the asker probably could have done that. In some SE communities this is fine, but for communities where lack of research is generally frowned upon, allowing these answers to be posted essentially encourages questions that the community does not generally want.

More importantly, it means that the Q/A pair is, for all intents and purposes, simply a bot's chat log. If I can ask the bot a question and get an answer, then I put that question and answer on an SE site, all I've really done is duplicate information that already exists on the internet. While certain SE sites definitely have their share of duplicate information (e.g. SO has a lot of questions whose answers can be found in documentation), it's still generally of no value to add additional duplication, especially when that information is just a copy of a Q/A session that can be had with a given GPT bot at any time. Duplicating logs of chats with bots doesn't really add any value to the internet. SE ultimately serves the purpose of getting knowledge out of small groups of peoples' heads and into large groups of peoples' heads, but this just duplicates what's already out there.


Therefore, because encouraging questions that communities don't want is obviously undesirable, and because duplicating logs of chats with bots doesn't really add any value anywhere, I think the ban should be permanent. In addition, of course, to all the other reasons given.

PS Furthering the above two points: These bots are trained on existing information, and as such they're not really creating new information. They're effectively just search engines that present reorganizations of existing information in the form of readable text. So asking them a question is roughly equivalent to Googling for a question and interpreting the results. In my opinion, bots should be treated with the same attitude as search engines are treated. And answers from bots should be treated the same as answers that are just copy+pasted Google results (i.e. valueless plagiarism).

Comment on Answer,"The duplication battle was lost a long time ago. The gamification encourages submitting answers to blatant duplicates, not to find the canonical questions.
