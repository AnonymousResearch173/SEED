1,,0,ItsAHardwareProblem,5,2852,None,0,"Have you tried using chatgpt for anything that isn’t basic? It’s habitually makes things up and imagines APIs to solve problems. I personally haven’t used stack-overflow or chatgpt to really solve any problems as I find SO tends to have dated answers, and chatgpt is both dated and makes stuff up. Imo the best way to solve problems is to properly learn to use a debugger and understand/read docs. Those problem solving skills will make you a much better engineer, and get you much further in your career - in my opinion",41,2023-09-01 16:59:43

3,1,1,Smallpaul,16503,138997,None,0,I use ChatGPT (4) on a daily basis and it has saved me many hours of going down wrong paths. It can take all of the knowledge of StackOverflow and apply it to your very specific situation.,6,2023-09-01 17:25:53
4,3,2,ItsAHardwareProblem,5,2852,None,0,"I’m happy it’s worked for you, but perhaps it’s because of the area of engineering I work in (big data - which frankly has changed a large amount since 2021) it feels useless (I’ve even tried ChatGPT - 4)

6,3,2,sudu10,118,32,None,0,What kind of work do you do? Maybe its useful for certain fields more so than others,4,2023-09-01 17:28:21
7,6,3,Smallpaul,16503,138997,None,0,"I'm a freelancer and researcher. It's hard to summarize as a single field.

I guess some common patterns are data transformations, event processing, API creation and consumption...

As a freelancer I might dive into a code base that's in an environment that I 70% understand and I ask ChatGPT (4) questions to understand the other 30%. ""What would this line of code do? Why would this line be in this context? Why do I get this error message when I run it?""

This saves me asking other busy developers those onboarding questions.

Also: ""Do a first past of porting this prototype code from my-prototyping-language to customers-production-language. Add appropriate type signatures.""

When I'm working in an environment I'm fully familiar with, it's an accelerator: ""Write me a CLI utility to test a function with this signature with an input document named on the CLI. Generate the boilerplate for a unit test for a function with this signature. Write a program to transform my sample data from a CSV to the customer-specified JSON format.""",1,2023-09-01 19:37:04

14,13,2,ItsAHardwareProblem,5,2852,None,0,"Chatgpt is great for generating ideas or seeing how it might approach a problem, however still requires a deep dive and human touch to take things to the end zone. Personally I sometimes use it as a sanity check or a way to spark some creativity, however haven’t had it solve any programming problems for me yet due to its “hallucinations”. I think aws and Microsoft both have a code version of a generative AI, which integrations with your IDE (aws version is codewhisperer, and I think Microsoft’s is co pilot) I would recommend spending time familiarizing yourself with those tools as they are code oriented and can definitely help improve productivity",8,2023-09-01 17:07:44
