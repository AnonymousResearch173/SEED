6,,0,id278437,327,8647,None,0,">Purdue University study tested ChatGPT on 517 Stack Overflow-style coding questions, 52% of ChatGPT's answers were factually incorrect.

*How* incorrect matters a great deal, because just getting pointed in the right direction is often enough even if the answer isn't fully correct, esp with continued chatting. I've been successfully debugging some really tricky bugs with ChatGPT4, where both contributed to the process, but it required some back and forth with various errors along the way.

Besides, degree of correctness isn't constant but depends on the prompt itself, and you get better result by breaking down the question or tasks into parts.",1,2023-08-18 01:16:37

8,,0,Commercial-Bet-5783,1,0,None,0,"I like to implement both. It’s helpful seeing human solutions but sometimes I can’t find exactly what I’m looking for. When I get deep into creating applications the things I need to find are very niche, making chatgpt very useful. Getting it to fork out solutions that actually works how I want can be very trivial, since it has a lot of trouble understanding context. I have to re-iterate myself many times before I get something applicable.",1,2023-08-18 22:34:49
