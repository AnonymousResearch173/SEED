Not to be pedantic, but I have to wonder how many of the people who are upset about this issue also use adblockers. Because I imagine it's a huge proportion. And it's not because they're hypocrites; I resisted using adblockers for years because of the ethics of obtaining information for free that someone else paid to collect and display. But I use an adblocker now because the internet is *absolute garbage.* [This article](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) calls what's happened ""enshitification,"" and I think it explains why people are so head-over-heels eager to use ChatGPT. Finding information online has been miserable for years, and we finally have effective relief.

Let's say no-one regulates what OpenAI and its competitors have done. It happened and it's over. All the shitty websites that dangled information you wanted behind 500 words of filler to keep you on the page while blasting you with ads shut down. Also, a lot of reasonably good websites that were creating valuable information (which was then being reposted by a mountain of shitty ones) go down with them. There's suddenly no way to learn new things on the internet; all we have is what AI knows and what you can ask a human, plus donation-based sites like Wikipedia that will probably never shut down, even though their traffic declined.

What do AI companies need, now? Information. And what do they have to do? Pay for it. Research, journalism on that research, solutions to weird tech problems, community discussions, etc. There's suddenly a market for unanswered questions. I don't know if anyone can say exactly what that looks like, but I know one thing: AI companies will pay for what once was paid for with ads. And my friend, I can't tell you how much nicer that's going to be. The internet does not need to be shitty. We can do better than this.",1,2023-07-27 22:09:21

What did we have back then? Library encyclopedias. Expensive to own, but relatively easy to access. Then we went to this wild distributed model, where information was coming from so many places that you couldn't do any kind of purchase or subscription model anymore. You can't expect people to subscribe to the individual google results they're getting back, right? So it went to advertising. I think we're going to see a reversal of that, back to silos (as you pointed out, we're already seeing it with Discord/etc). Except now, your Encyclopedia has 1000x as much information in it and it talks to you and teaches you things.

I am certain that libraries will soon have AI subscriptions, which I hope people who are too poor for an ad-free tier would take advantage of.

Outside of sponsored links, you see almost zero advertisements on Google itself. They tried doing a subscription for the distributed ad model, but [it didn't work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Contributor), I would guess because it didn't have wide enough participation and couldn't compete with ad blocker, anyway. All that is to say, a subscription to Google would have no additional value, because the ads aren't on Google. It would just feel like price gouging at this point.

The comparison really starts to break down when you look at cost-per-user. Searches are dirt cheap. AI is crushingly expensive. You just can't make that much ad revenue per user. If GPT4-quality AI is available at search-engine prices, we might see ad-supported AI, but even then they'd still take a subscription payment. Why? Because it'd make way more money per-user, and unlike a search engine, it would actually add value. That's why Hulu does it: People will pay for it.

>(where even if one product is better, the other options are good enough that many people won't want to pay for the better one).

One of the obstacles when building a good model is not overtraining it to the point it's just 'remembering' the data it's been trained on.

But the issue the previous comment made proves that it could be beneficial to do this if you are able to claim credit for what a model produces.

298,,0,TylerDurdenJunior,48148,45163,None,0,"As a long time developer, I am honestly in complete shock by the SO hate on this post.

Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that the only place with a standard high enough to train an effective LLM on, would be hated on by the users of the LLM.

If you sort by new and unanswered questions on SO, you will see just exactly why there are strict rules on asking questions.

SO is not for your minor uncertainty or first attempt at solving a problem. The amount of questions ""answered"" by an OP themselves moments later with some ""Nevermind, I forgot to add a closing bracket"" is staggering.

What people here are interpreting as arrogance and malicious intent is experienced users taking their time to answer people's questions freely.

You SHOULD be hesitant to ask a question on SO.

That means you will first try all you can to search for an actual answer, to actually frame your questioning. I cannot count how many times I have found something to try out that have solved my issues just my thoroughly structuring my question.

For newbie questions or quick feedback, use ""learn programming"" or ""programmingquestions"" on reddit, IRC or discord. THAT is the purpose of those tools.

The purpose of SO is in no way, shape or form that.

It is for high quality answered, to high quality questions.

""why does my conda environment fail on my home computer, but works on my job"" type questions is not high quality. Especially when 50 other users have asked pretty much the same question in the last week, only with some specifics to their own setup. 

It is a local and isolated question that can only be answered in a local and isolated context.

If you framed the same question, with with cross referenced chiseled out error messages, included possible similar issues from doing some research, with a focused description of what it is you fail to understand, THEN users would be able to actually help you.

SO is NOT the place to go to for casual help on something we are to lazy to look into or solve ourselves. And that is the power of SO. 

Asking low quality unstructured questions have to be discredited in order to keep both questions and answers in a high enough quality for an LLM to be able to use it. 

With out the gatekeeping of low quality questions, the quality of answers will dry up. 

Without the quality answers to quality questions on SO, the quality of LLM's will dry up, as an LLM is not able to actually answer anything, but only reference the most useful previously answered question in the context.",3,2023-07-27 09:30:25

Reddit was never designed to have r/learnprogramming specifically to ask ""newbie questions or quick feedback"", so saying this is the ""purpose"" of r/learnprogramming makes no sense. That's your opinion and is also what contributes to the toxicity of SO. That's why people hate SO.
