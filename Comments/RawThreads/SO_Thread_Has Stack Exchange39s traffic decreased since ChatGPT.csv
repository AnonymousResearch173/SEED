Question,"I was wondering whether the traffic of Stack Exchange sites went down since the open access to ChatGPT. There is so much gossip in terms of ""Will programmers be unnecessary with ChatGPT? Will coding tutors be unnecessary with ChatGPT?"". You know the deal...
Although I do not believe all that stuff and already have a manifest opinion, I think it would be a very fine survey of Stack Exchange to do!

Comment on Question,"@JourneymanGeekOnStrike I wouldn't interpret too much into it. Eternal growth is impossible, but a single month of decline could still be an exception or a seasonal effect for example.

Answer,"Query & Visualization of Total User Votes Per Month Since 2009 as a Metric for Observing User Activity Trends using Stack Exchange Data Explorer (SEDE)
Similar to starball's answer, here is another perspective of insight into user activity trends (specifically on Stack¬†Overflow) using SEDE, looking at the sum of user votes across all questions binned by month per year. In the graph that results from the query, the x-axis refers to the number of months since New Year's Day 2024; the data goes back roughly to -180, corresponding to 15 years ago (i.e., 2009).

Annotations added to figure using Adobe Photoshop.
Of course, this gives no specific insight into ChatGPT. But for whatever reasons, there appears to be an ongoing precipitous decline in user activity that began in 2020 and significantly worsened in 2023.
Appendix
Here is the SEDE SQL query (which, by the way, was almost entirely generated from a short conversation with ChatGPT ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è):
WITH MonthlyVotes AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(v.CreationDate) AS YearValue,
        MONTH(v.CreationDate) AS MonthValue,
        SUM(CASE WHEN v.VoteTypeId = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Upvotes,
        SUM(CASE WHEN v.VoteTypeId = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Downvotes

Answer,"I made some SEDE queries for new question activity, new answer activity, and new user creations per month from 2018 to now (2018 chosen somewhat arbitrarily- I just wanted some more context than looking at just 2022-2023). I'll link to queries for stats on a per-site (using Stack Overflow as the default since it's the biggest site in the Stack Exchange network) and network-wide basis. Thanks to @AwesomePoodles for their cross-site SEDE query template.
Note that you should ignore the recent-most data points in the graphs (/ the sharp dropoffs in the below screenshots for the most recent data point), since they're for the current month, which isn't over yet, and hence doesn't have complete data. I was just too lazy to adjust the query to omit those data points.
New Question Activity Dropped
Per-site: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1717975/new-question-activity-per-month-since-2018#graph
Network-wide: https://data.stackexchange.com/meta.stackexchange/query/1717977/network-wide-new-questions-per-month-since-2018#graph

There's usually a sharp drop in activity in December. It was quite pronounced in 2018 and 2019, but not so much in 2020 and 2021. It was quite pronounced in 2022, so it's hard to tell to what degree this is just the normal drop in activity due to time off work and winter break, and to what degree this is from people going to ask their questions to ChatGPT instead of on Stack Exchange.
However, in recent past years, there has always been a pick-up of activity levels in Januaries (observable for 2018-2022), but not so for Jan 2023: The level of new question activity is pretty much the same as the December 2022 level. Interpret that how you will.
New Answers
This graph compares non-deleted and deleted new answer activity per-site:
https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1717973/new-answers-per-month-since-2018#graph

Though the drop in answers is proportional to drop in questions.
Answer activity in general on Stack Overflow has been in decline since mid-2020.
Similar observations as were made for new questions also apply here. The decline between November 2022 and December 2022 for non-deleted questions was 11.0%. Notice the never-seen-before increase in deleted answer posts from November 2022 to December 2022.
New User Registration Activity Dropped
Per-site: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1717972/new-users-per-month-since-2018#graph
Network-wide: https://data.stackexchange.com/meta.stackexchange/query/1717979/network-wide-new-users-per-month-since-2018#graph


In 2018, there was a 13.1% dip in new users in December, and a recovery in the following January.
In 2019, there was a 7.6% increase from November to December, and a further 8.0% increase in the following January.
In 2020, there was little change going into December, and a 9.1% increase in the following January.
In 2021, there was a 6.1% drop in December, and a 15.4% recovery in the following January
In 2022, there was a 5.8% drop in December, and a further 12.9% drop in the following January.

Conclusions
Observations: There was no recovery of new question activity and a further drop in new user registrations in January 2023 following December 2022, both of which are declines compared to trends from previous years.
Possible contributing factors:

People are using ChatGPT instead of Stack Exchange. This is likely a significant contributing factor. I've been looking at things people say about Stack Exchange on Reddit and there are plenty of recent comments of people saying that they've been trying to use ChatGPT instead of Stack Overflow, and suggesting that others do the same. (Granted, those tend to be low-score compared to other comments talking about the problems with ChatGPT)

People who use ChatGPT to write answers on sites where it's banned (such as Stack Overflow) are getting suspended, and therefore cannot ask or answer questions.

Activity drops coincide with major tech layoffs in January 2023 and following months. I don't think it's possible to rule out as a contributing factor, especially with most of the largest sites in the Stack Exchange network being tech-related.


More queries and updates / follow-up
I've done further related analyses in my answer post to GPT on the platform: Data, actions, and outcomes. I'm keeping tabs on all my SEDE queries, and I've noticed that the dramatic declines seem to have stopped in the recent months and have stabilized, with some looking like they are about to take recovery paths.

Answer,"On Stack Overflow
I looked at https://meta.stackoverflow.com/site-analytics today.
1. General trend

There has been a steady decline in new questions and new answers for the past several years.
There is a similar decline in up- and downvotes, also for the past several years.
For site visits, however, no such decline is seen.

My interpretation of this is that Stack¬†Overflow is immensely helpful,
but more and more people need no longer interact with the site; they only
need to use a search engine for finding the existing answers to their question.
2. Trend since ChatGPT has been published late Nov 2022

There are a few short spikes, but the general trends for new questions and new answers have not changed.
The same is true for up- and downvotes.
For site visits, however, the values surged up in December 2022,
were still more than double their value from previous years in January/February 2023, and (as of August 2023) are slowly going back to their previous value since.

My interpretation of this is that the relationship of ChatGPT and Stack¬†Overflow created a huge media buzz, but no dramatic change in the viewers' use of the site.
Note that the issue of moderators blocking ChatGPT-generated posts is not shown in these data.
A surge in additional ChatGPT-generated answers, however, should show up in these data...
...BUT:
As of 2023-08-24, the Stack Overflow site analytics page has a remark at the top saying

Effective May 10th 2022, the traffic data in this chart is outdated. We are working to resolve the issue. [This update was posted on July 26, 2023]

And indeed the numbers on the vertical axes are all so low that the data cannot be the daily sums data I would expect them to be.
For example, that ""normal"" level of visits shown pre-2022-12 is about ""1k"".
Hmmm.
